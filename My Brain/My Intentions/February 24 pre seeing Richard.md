## What do I want?
- kissing on top of me
## What is best case?
- i no longer feel unsure
- him to show he can be empathetic
- him to show he is curious about my depths not just share his own 
## What do I not want?
- to be bored in his bedroom
- to be passive because i am scared of rejection
- to call it official
## How will I get there?
- talk about things that matter
- don't be so stressed/careful about it - be myself as much as possible that's the ideal isn't it?

## How did it go
- i get everything i want because i ask for it
- it was good, he did ask more about me but idk if i agree with his outlook. he is counter to his parents so struggles to empathize with them. he says it doesn't matter how they feel it's my life and like yes technically, but i like to live in harmony. 
- unsure about his views on gender roles and lgbtq issues - china is conservative
- i wouldn't be gaining another family because he is not close to them and they speak mainly chinese
