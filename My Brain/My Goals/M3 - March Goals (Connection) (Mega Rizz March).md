## Focus: connection with friends, family, world and self - being friendly and open to the social world
(alternatively known as mega rizz march)
### What
- start each morning with 4 deep breaths
- setting intention each morning/before interactions/events
- appreciate opportunities and bids for connection - full presence, not wishing to be elsewhere
- putting effort into friendships - talk regularly, see each other (see anika once at least, text john/call biweekly at least? invite ivan to another clubbing at least once, go climbing each week)
- making effort - just approach others, just invite others, mix groups it's not a big deal
- journaling at least every other day
- planning/pitching social ideas
- every interaction is opportunity to find connection with someone - it is my responsibility
- finish platonic book
### Why
- this is a golden opportunity to be social - taking absolute advantage while I can
- I want real friends that stay
- feeling social optimism towards the world - like I belong here
- i have wanted to be a charismatic person for so long - escaping the trap of awkward/shy
### How
- take initiative for social events
- assume people will like me already - it is my responsibility to find connection
- talk to one stranger a day
- smile/say hi to everyone I pass
- make small talk with employees in public
- talk to 2 people at each open mic
- go to every social opportunity
- open mic at least every other week
## When
- talk to strangers - on the train, on walk, in restaurants, at climbing, at work
- smile/greet at people confidently when i see them
- do not supress social ideas - just invite confidently and accept reaction
- at work - initiate deeper connection, listen to others, have fun
- when I want to do something do not hesitate, just invite people
- join the group - no hesitance or meekness fuck that
- when i want to - i always know what i have to/should do - fuck all the thinking just do it
