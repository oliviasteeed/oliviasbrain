## Recap 
### Focus
- didn't go into the year with a particular focus? I think I wanted to recover fully from ED and do courses all year so I could do 438 and then field school. Despite wanting more from him, I also wanted to recover from 235? I was literally destroyed at the end of that semester I just laid on the floor all of winter break i have never felt so depleted in my life
- lol I'm reading my journal now and I was so gutted I just wanted to win Russell's approval more than anything and for what
- fear of stagnation - thanks Russell for drive to constantly improve
- desire for romantic interest as always but it felt like a very distant aspiration back then
### Goals
- ??? did i honestly have any???
- field school at all costs
### Highlights
- Recording and releasing album with Elliot. I feel like something inside of me can finally be released at a level I can be proud of and it's euphoric I am sooo lucky. Sharing the music, seeing how excited it makes him/me/mom and dad, getting to take all the photos for it and make the website/lyric videos. It was quite an endeavour and I am so proud of it as a product I made, but also know I could do better now (thanks to the new mic but also I am a better singer and know how to use Reaper a lot more now.) Just sharing the songs - being so radically open feels so good. Nobody can judge me if i just put it all out there with no regard. 
- SAP internship - sooooooooo much growth from here fuck. Learning how logistics of office work, communicating with other adults in a workplace, professionalism, design skills, Figma libraries, components, autolayout (!), also related skills like socializing (remembering how to interact and exist like a person), leaving the house regularly, commuting, being downtown regularly (knowing how to navigate, super comfortable taking the skytrain and just walking around downtown), some crushes/romantic experience, making friends!!! 
- Dating John for a month. What a growth opportunity. Glad I could rip the bandaid off, it seems much less of a big deal but also less mysterious what dating is like at all. I know (???) how to kiss with tongue now. She's all grown up. Honestly though he was/is very sweet and I'm grateful we're still friends and I still have someone to talk to/share my life with/reflect off of. It's nice to have a friend. He makes me feel like I exist. I realize my mental issues were from isolation. The issues that arose within me and that led to the breakup were also food for a lot of introspection and growth because that's an area I am stunted because I hadn't had any romantic experience. It also helped me realize that I wasn't healthy and needed to eat more so I could be a real woman and not so rigid and on the edge. If I ever want to be in a functional relationship (and functional in a relationship) I need to not restrict and know I am healthy so I know they don't like me for a body that's temporary/the product of restriction. That being said I don't think I could do the weight-gain journey while dating him so another good reason we broke up. It also gave me a lot of insight into what I am looking for in a partner in life. Someone who can drive apparently. I'm honestly still not entirely sure what the deal is there in terms of a mental block or just the way it is but I don't think it should have to be hard? He's just so online and kind of immature as a result of not living in the world with oversight/strong parental influenxe and also just being 20 and he felt like a kid to me at times and that was the issue.
- camping trip to the Sunshine Coast with Elliot. My soul was so profoundly happy during this trip. I loved the last-minute chaos of it and how we just hiked and sat in the sun all day. My favourite memory is sitting with my feet in the water and watching starfish move and touching feet with it for fun. Also walking through the woods full of huge mossy trees with Elliot that felt like it would never end. Reassuring that there is some beauty left in the world, but also sad the sun rises on the ocean and forests every day and I don't get to see it. What do I really want/need in life? I have so much privilege to be able to entertain rejecting capitalism.
- Taylor Swift concert with Anika. I was still in my sheltered era back then so driving to Seattle, crossing border, planning, staying in a hotel! The concert itself - to be honest I just remember my awe. And I don't think I knew Evan had a gf yet so probably projecting him on all the songs, especially Enchanted. Love how that song just came to me after talking to him for the first time and I listened to it all the way home. I was a different girl back then. It was a cultural moment and I'm so grateful I shared that with her.
- having friends? tied to SAP internship but going climbing every week and even just eating lunch with people is sooo nice fuck. Reminds me of high school. How can I foster this when I return to SFU in 8 months (fuck). my mental health issues were actually just symptoms of extreme isolation and i can't go back.
- ending Spring term - best term I've ever done grades-wise, it's been awhile but I felt pretty good at the end I recall. It was a slow recovery from 235 but I ended up enjoying it and learning/appreciating all my courses and my friendship with Gus the first person at SFU to treat me like a human and appreciate and respect me. Deapite being a stoner he kind of got it and would actually level with me about the project and life whereas everyone else is too fake to be honest. also talking to Josh for 20 minutes after the 359 final and when he left he said "Olivia, it was a pleasure" and it made my body feel things lmao
- mytakeaway personal project and reading more and being intentional about it, highlighting and taking notes so I can keep the insights in one place. Being aware and intentional about my desire/thirst to constantly learn that keeps compounding after 201, 235 and then John. The more I learn the more I have to draw from which I really appreciate. Transfer to Obsidian has also been fun, it is exciting to think of having a lot to reference when I return to uni and also just in everyday life if I want to do any sort of writing. The amount I have learned has been a lot and it has really changed my worldview and self understanding. I want to know everything (about social science)
- when Elliot and I went to Mayne Island and were walking through town coincidentally when the thrift store in town was open (only 2 hours a week) and just looking through/making fun of everything together was so much fun. I love our drifting-style trips where we just wander around and experience life. It's so different from my normal life where I am highly structured and productive. It's nice to give yourself permission to just let it go sometimes and be again. Still trying to reconcile presence with productivity cause you can't really have both. 
- Realizing I will never be able to fully grow up without eating more - you cannot be fully functional if you are semirestricting. I realized that there was so much more than me and it was irrelevant - thank you how to change your mind book on shrooms for teaching me this zoom out mindset. My body is not the project, the project is (and the project is essay/graphic novel about beauty and control and ED recovery). I am so happy I was able to get here myself, not through being forced, because it means it is mine and also that I feel good, I am not resistant. I am growing up! and I like having an ass again. 
- Turning 21. This is real adult shit now. idk why but it actually felt different. it was time to daddy up and stop being a victim and just do it. everything is in my control you create your reality
- the amount of watermelon I ate this summer was astronomical and also amazing I fucking love watermelon and enjoyed every slice to the fullest 
- laying in the sun during my lunch break every day back when i worked from home three days a week in the summer ahhhhhhh those were the days. feeling the sun on me is kind of the closest thing i can get to god. feels like i am being held and loved by the world and will never need anything else.
- taking every social opportunity at work - it has really turned my life around. now to extend beyond work to other places to be social. 
- when i came back from ny trip with covid and laid in bed for 3 days - the profound sense of gratitude that just flooded me cause i was home (a much better place to be sick) was unlike anything i'd experienced before
### Lowlights
- read my journal and fuck i was low low last winter. crying and feeling like i don't deserve to be alive/want to disappear def a low
- breaking up with John but not really, it had to be done and I don't regret it and I learned a lot from it and we're still friends so nevermind but damn can you imagine if that worked out anyways
- any time I am defensive and combative instead of gracious and loving (esp with mom and dad)
- making mom cry
- skipping breakfast/packing barely any lunch when going to work for a few months and on and off semirestricting as a distraction
- not taking opportunities - social, romantic, work, growth - when things are uncomfortable I want to run but I need to move forward and through (how to change your mind actually did change my mind damn)
- times being complacent not proactive
- not sleeping enough to make time for social
- being self destructive when i am unsure or stressed and chewing cheeks/cuticles/staying up late doing nothing because i don't want to think about myself
### Realizations
- getting out has to be built into my life or else I will not do it, but I need to do it to want to be alive
- I love working downtown!!!!!!!! I am not scared when I leave the house alone anymore and i love it there it's so alive and there's so many places to walk to
- I will never be able to be in a functional relationship if I don't deal with my body issues and that means not restricting and releasing food anxiety and guilt and coming to terms with myself as someone who could be potentially beautiful and sexy 
- my body is not the project
- making music is the thing that makes me feel most fulfilled in life (maybe second to or tied with being social with people I connect with). Elliot and I have stumbled upon a truly divine endeavour and making songs with him feels like drugs and like I am doing what I am supposed to
- Design is bullshit but I love a toxic relationship so not sure what to do about this - unsure about ux design because it's so excessive and wasteful in that it isn't even used a lot of the time. Making specs can be very tedious and boring. You're just designing a dialog box spacing who fucking cares? Especially at SAP where it is so dev-led, ux is basically a check over and maybe light spacing change rather than an actual process or respected discipline. And when you do anything the devs probably wont implement it anyways. UA is more tangible because everything gets used, but it's only bandaid fixes for shitty ux. I like explaining and teaching but also who gives a fuck when I'm teaching people why they should buy sac for planning or how to change formatting in their story. I really like making storyboards to figure out how to visually convey information and then doing the animations in AfterEffects. I like being the designer and consulting with others but owning a project myself and being in control. I like making the call. I like working independently mainly and then getting feedback. I do not like organizing collaboration or splitting work between lots of people, especially when they are less good at it than me. That's another problem with ux there's way to many stakeholders it's just very 3 hour meetings based instead of just doing the damn thing
- AI isn't the worst thing in the world - I actually wish it was implemented more in the softwares I use or better yet the Universal Interface so i could just say what i want to do and get a custom interface to suit it made of reconfigurable parts trained on best practice patterns that is tailored to me with my past preferences and actions and abilities 
- fuck all the talking let's do it. i can just do things. don't let what others (parents) might think influence you because what if it fails or they think i'm wasting my effort or i can't explain it. this is my life and i will follow my obsessions with everything i have.
- just move in any direction to build momentum - it doesn't have to be the right one (ig me and john)
### Appreciation
- elliot - giving me the gift of music that I can feel proud of. I will never be able to express my gratitude adequately for what his contribution to our partnership means to me. I could never have music I am proud enough of to release without his skill. Also he adds his own interpretation and flair and makes it so it's not a self indulgent endeavour, it's a bonding and release experience. 
- john - where to start? seeking me out, reminding me how to socialize/text, being someone to share my life with, intense curiosity and openness, acceptance, interest, romantic/dating experience, nonjudgment, teaching me about pkm/objectives and intention setting with reviews and planning, showing me how much is possible, showing me everyone has the potential to change/grow/improve, being a kindred soul (in some regards) to observe and make sense of the world with, wanting to see me, teaching me how to be a person again, challenging my worldviews, expanding my horizons. i think brain orgasm best describes how i felt when we started talking. the single most influential person on my life/worldview/wellbeing this year. also thanks for my two best (?) songs. 
- ivan - i love how charasmatic he is. trying to talk to me when i was soooo shy and awkward at the start and not just judging or writing me off for that. being curious and initiating interesting conversation. not being afraid to engage in critique or deep conversation and questioning. sharing his ambition and career aspirations - it helps to give me a different point of view than the traditional path i grew up with. being funny and silly and chill and initiating social like it's no big deal and maybe you don't have to be afraid at all. respecting my design abilities enough to ask my opinion all the time on what he is doing. always helping me out when he can. going to all the events i do. i'm really going to miss this life. 
- richard - my wednesday lunch buddy because he's the only other intern who comes in. i appreciate him for initiating socializing with me and coming to get me for lunch and not shying away from deep/upsetting conversations and sharing anything i ask him. he is so authentically himself for better or worse and i admire the no regard he pays to normalcy. thanks for crying in front of me and not being weird about it after. i like hearing another artist's perspective on the world. i wish he could find some peace. 
- joanna - for hiring me, for believing in me even when I started sobbing on my first day in front of her, for being so kind and open and honest and supportive of me. she really respects my abilities and wants me to succeed. she is also very proficient and confident at her job and it's fun to see a single woman in her 40s just living her best life. 
- annah - initiating the climbing thing that we just do every week. i love having a regular social activity. being so chill about being social - she just asks you to do stuff or comes to get you like it's nothing. i guess that's confidence. she's so cool how she's involved in student union and has been a ta and worked in research and wants to do masters and can do 40 chin ups. i appreciated hanging out with her at the christmas party. it's fun to have a person to latch onto. i think that's all i ever want
- mom - warmth, love, unconditional acceptance, emotional support, listening when I need it, taking care of me, taking care of us - cooking, groceries, laundry. She runs our household and keeps our family together and I have such a profound gratitude and appreciation for the light she brings into my life. also being so supportive of our music she's a very sweet number one fan
- dad - intellectual equality, curiosity, shared music, interest, bringing me new resources and points of view to my life, challenging and educating me with new perspectives from his learnings/life, not getting too involved or judging my decisions (at least to my face), singing just another lonely girl the loudest, not looking down on me when i am at my worst
- jenny - pulling me out to go shopping/out for dinner because she knew I needed some social. very sweet of her. she really tries and even though she is so different and helplessly fixed minset there is a consciousness in there trying to understand and figure out the world just like all of us that i can connect to
- evan - reminding me how it feels to have a very strong crush and how beautiful some people can be (to the point where you can barely breathe idk if i've ever even had that before) and how to flirt/interact with boys and joke with my sense of humour and not being weird when I asked him if he had a gf and he said yes and for Just Another Lonely Girl in the Crowd which is one of if not the best song on the album 
- cici - being so welcoming to me when I came to intern games the first time all scared and shy and unsure how to be social, inviting me to the art gallery and going on the weird ass taylor swift boat cruise thing with me. she's sweet but sad. i need to text her good luck on her exchange.
- sap internship - see above but yeah life changing holy shit i am glad i last minute applied to this
- the sun - warmth and acceptance and life
- the meaning of things - for the realization that no possession will ever make me happy or fill the void
- how to change your mind - the concept of zooming out that happens when people are on psychedelics and experience ego death so are just part of everything else and the overproduction and issues of life becomes irrelevant
