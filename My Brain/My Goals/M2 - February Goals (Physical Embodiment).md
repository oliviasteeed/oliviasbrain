## Focus: physically taking care of myself
### What
- no cuticle picking
- no cheek chewing
- no skin picking
- at least 8 hours of sleep 
- daily meditation breathing
- clear skin on chin - no face touching and no picking
- healthy eating - not just protein and sugar
- no mindless screen time/restless distraction activities
- not standing always at desk - don't want swollen ankles
- not wearing heels
- not wasting the current moment worrying about the future
- [x] health record of health history, medications taken etc
### Why
- feeling physically more energetic
- feeling more put together
- feeling like I am doing my body justice, taking responsibility for her
- feeling more confident
- embracing, accepting and overcoming instead of diverting anxiety into physical and behavioural coping mechanisms
### How
- wearing rings so I can fidget with them instead of picking my skin
- brushing my teeth as soon as I get in the bathroom instead of delaying with skin picking
	- I think this is because I want more unstructured time? I could use this reading or sleeping though so nah
- not texting or listening to music before bed - gateway drugs
- eating healthy leftovers first
## When
- after meals cuticle pick
- when talking to others/needing relief stimulation cuticle pick
- chew cheeks when working
- after or before meals (when hungry) cheek chew
- when getting home late and eating a lot
- after breakfast eating a lot
- after workout stretching

## Reflection: How did it go?

### Review
What went well?
- barely cuticle picked all month
- do feel pretty good about physical body
What could have gone better?
- did eat a lot late a lot of the time
- face picked semiregularly
- started cheek chewing late in month to deal with romantic stress
- sleep is getting neglected because i am so social
- not being insecure about my body - hard to tell how much is too much
What did I learn?
- replacing behaviours is helpful - playing with rings instead of cuticle pic
- i can eat kind of indefinitely so just cut it off you know how much is reasonable
- if you start eating late you will eat tol much, just go to bed and eat breakfast tomorrow
What will I take with me?
- rings to not cuticle pick
- trying to avoid eating too much too late so i don't get into binge purge cycle - a struggle cause i don't want to have food rules but also prob shouldn't eat past 8-10 to prevent eating too much too late
- more sleep! but how?
Next Time
