## From John

 What big questions about my life am I asking myself?
 - am I actually healthy? (I was)
 - what do I want after school? I don't think the traditional life is enough

 If I knew I couldn’t fail what would I focus on?
 - music - I would try to actually make it?
 - making some kind of product to help you live

 What do I know to be true that I'm not acting on?
 - passions
 - pkm
 - engaging in passions with intensity instead of being limited by fear of what it reveals about me/parental judgment

 What do I want for myself?
 - I want to actualize
 - I was a sick pkm system to compound my knowledge over time
 - I want independence and freedom to experiment, try things out, make mistakes, figure out who I am and how to live/be an adult
 - I want friends I can rely on and see sometimes
 - I want to leave the house regularly
 - I want to go out by myself more
 - I want a relationship potentially or at least put myself in scenarios that could open me up to that

 What would I love to learn?
- more about music production and mixing
- vocal technique
- more about evolution of culture - biological and social basis
- how to obtain and keep maximum clarity
- where to go clubbing
- how to share my learnings/insights to elevate others

Wisest decision
- last minute applying for my job at SAP instead of going to school for like 9 straight semesters - nothing changes unless you change something

 Biggest lesson
 - you can't become an adult while acting like a child
 - you can't be functional in a relationship if you aren't good with yourself - especially physically

 Biggest risk
 - dating John when I was always ambivalent about it?
 - applying for SAP job even though it's 8 months and then extended to 16 months

 Biggest surprise
 - dating John - before this dating felt like some far away thing that could never actually happen for me
 - becoming mentally well - all it took was leaving the house on my own, public transit and people my age to socialize with

 3 Most influential people
 - John - changed my life in all ways basically.
 - Gus - showed me such kindness and friendship when I had forgotten how to do that. Nobody in uni treated and respected me like a full human before him
 - Evan - waking me out of my trance - reminding me what it feels to want to leave the house and have my own life and be alive and how it feels to be passionately attracted to somebody

 - mom/dad too - emotional/financial support 

 3 People You Influenced
 - Gus - he really admired my work ethic/school philosophy and said I changed his life. I'm glad I could take him for a ride and show him that it doesn't have to be so hard/last minute/crazy and you can do very well if you just plan accordingly
 - Joanna - she said she's enjoying her job more than she has in 10 years because of me and the projects I am allowing them to do. I appreciate working with her so closely and will miss her dearly when my internship is over.
 - John? - giving him more grounded perspective and bringing him into the real world a bit

 Not able to accomplish
 - acoustic version of It's Never Enough
 - getting period

 Most important thing I did for others
 - unconditionally accepted and then broke up with John
 - emotional support for Elliot - trying to permeate
 - positivity and down for anything/high quality of work/showing up every day at work

 How would l love to grow?
 - confidence
 - assertiveness - believing what I say has value and deserves to be heard
 - vocal technique/music production
 - promotion - music and etsy
 - involvement in community/going out more

 Forgive yourself for
 - traumatizing mom with eating disorder
 - spending so long thinking I was a powerless victim when it was all in my control actually
 - semirestricting because I have a compulsion to fit beauty standards

 Let go of
 - compulsion towards thinness/body shame
 - shame about sexuality/pleasure/experimenting with life
 - feelings of guilt for traumatizing family/being hard to live with
 - rushing/negative quality of presense
 - shyness/assuming others wont want to hear from/see me
 - thinking what I say has no value/doesn't deserve to be heard

## Mindset section

 What attitudes, beliefs and behaviors do I want to shed?
 - 

 What activities do I want to walk away from?

 - over or under eating and vigilance about food and body
 - feeling sorry for myself
 - shyness/self-imposed social limitations
 - feeling like I am missing out and that life is 'out there' - if it is just go out there and join

 What do I need to say no to?

 - comparison with others making me feel like I am not doing enough/anything worthwhile

 - consistent book reading and notetaking

 What habits and behaviors do I want to stop?

 - working out 6 days a week
 - sleeping ~8-9 hours a night
 - eating healthy
 - reading regularly and taking notes
 - making music - writing and recording songs
 - quality time with family
 - being social with peers my age

 How will I challenge myself?
 - making social opportunities - friends, meetup, design community, when I go back to uni
 - taking charge - at work in projects being proactive, intern committee scheduling events
 - not falling into victim mindset
 - not focusing so much on grades when I go back to uni
 - not spending money unless absolutely necessary/no way to spend less

 What permission do I need to give myself? (e.g. it’s ok to walk away from that relationship that isn’t serving me, it’s ok to slow down, it’s ok to put myself first, etc.)
 - permission to not fir beauty standards and some people are going to see me as less valuable and that's okay
 - permission to enjoy sensual life
 - permission to disagree with parents (especially mom) and do things they might not do or understand
 - permission to have my own life/put myself first to build my own life and self
 - permission to be young and have fun/make questionable decisions at times

 What internal obstacles do I need to break down? (e.g. limiting beliefs, creative blocks, etc.)
 - I am not worth being heard
 - enjoying life is hedonism and you have to struggle to justify existence
 - sex and wanting to appear seductive is shameful and gross and wrong
 - being my own person/making my own life is selfish
 - I am unattractive
 - I am narcissistic
 - I am ditzy
 - I am shy and awkward and a bad conversationalist

 What external obstacles do I anticipate facing? How will prepare? (e.g. layoff, pandemic, tough boss, etc.)
 - going back to uni will be an adjustment - I will not fall back into my routine there although it would be easy to do that given it has been my norm for 3 years. I will not let it crumble me. I will not let it take all my social and personal growth away from me. I will not let it kill my passion or consume my life and self worth. It is just one part of me and I want to be made of lots of parts.
 - probably being rejected by another guy but I'm getting used to it and it means I'm taking chances
