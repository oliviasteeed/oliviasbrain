what do i do?? she is so upset? i feel like i broke her. of course everyone is allowed to struggle and feel their emotions but i don't know how to help her considering i hurt her. 

are some things better kept inside? maybe to the people near you. the level of honesty i have with music and writing is a little much for people that actually know me but would be endearing to those who don't. i guess if you know me in real life it's disortenting because it challenges what you perceive as reality? you usually don't see directly into someone's head and maybe that's a good thing? reminds me of reading john and richard's notes - it's a little much honestly like jesus. everyone's inner thoughts are gross. and i like it but. hmmmm. perhaps boundaries are necessary for life but a girl does not like. is it just because of effort? maybe i'm too lazy to keep things from people but honestly i think it's that i feel entitled to share everything i'm thinking to let it go. i need to bounce off of people to be real. i need to share it to make it real?

i make myself through self expression. i figure out how i feel by expressing it.
