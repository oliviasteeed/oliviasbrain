## outline: my body is not the project: reflections on beauty and control
thesis: beauty is misplaced effort to satisfy innate need for control and order

- how did this happen to me?
	- ignorance
- self control as morality
	- denial of pleasure is morality
- power
	- design to control so you don't need force - soft power (iat 206w) - panopticon
- what then?
	- most conventionally attractive self went into world with nothing to give 
		- couldn't even walk across convocation mall
	- need to be social
	- cannot handle entropy of sedated
		- beauty myth - sedation means

My body is not the project.

But it's hard not to feel that way
When it's everywhere
You don't even realize you're comparing yourself to everything and everyone else
until it's too late and the things you objectively don't agree with have become entangled with your values so deeply that to extract it would be to put everything at risk.
Sometimes it feels like everywhere I look there is another sign that I am wrong, another hint at what is apparently good and right and worth aspiring to.
But is it?
What in this world is worth the effort and energy required to actively deprive your body of the most basic need for life?
I used to treat the feeling of hunger as a reward. Something to celebrate. Something I looked forward to, because it meant I could eat just enough to regain consciousness and then repeat the cycle and wait all over again.
If I applied the same discipline I do to my body to other pursuits I would know 6 languages and be classically trained on guitar by now.
Instead I haven't had my period for 3 years and some physical intimacy issues.

The issue with eating disorders though, is that they work.
I spent a lot of years profoundly ashamed of my body. 
It felt like showing myself at all was an act of rebellion against what a body should be.
So of course, I wore a lot of yoga pants and crop tops because the only thing worse than being insecure is letting on that you are.
I remember when baggy jeans were trendy and no matter how much I sized up I could not find a pair that wasn't tight on my thighs.
My body was an inescapable constant that I could not change with any amount of Youtube cardio workouts.

So it became a fixation, as happens with things you cannot have.
I wanted to feel delicate.
Feminine.
Why did I always have to be the tallest, biggest, hairiest girl?
My ankles were bigger than my father's.

At the same time, I entered a combative relationship with food.
It was hedonistically enjoyable, but it was also my enemy. It was what had made me this way, and I hated what that was.
But stuck at home with no structure amidst the pandemic, meals â€“ food â€“ became the primary structure of my day.
Wake up, eat, do something pointless, probably time to eat again, wait until I'm hungry, eat, sleep. Repeat.
It began to take up more and more of my brain space until the transition from binge eating to anorexia was seamless.

One day I thought to myself, what if I cut my usual portion of food in half? What would happen?
I was the heaviest I had ever been and frequently binge eating, probably as a distraction from and result of my toxic relationship with achievement in university. 
After I ate, I would glare at my thighs, my belly, my arms with such a violence as if my eyes alone could melt the flesh right off, leaving only bones in their place. 
Then I would be beautiful.
And sure, there was reason to change. 
I did not like feeling physically uncomfortable and like I could not breathe after eating. 
It wasn't a healthy way to live.
But then again, neither is starving yourself.
So I told myself I would still eat when hungry, but stop right as I felt full.
And it may have started this way, and I got compliments that wow I looked amazing and good for you, and the amount of food required to feel full became less and less.
It felt good to have such a small impact in the world.
I barely ate, I barely moved. I barely made a sound, I barely took up any space.
Is this what it means to be a woman?
Is this what it means to be beautiful?

Growing into a woman requires a complicated recognition and acceptance of an inherited troubled relationship with beauty.
As a child I rejected beauty signifiers like makeup and hair dye. 
I said I would never pluck my eyebrows.
I did not want to conform because it felt like I had to.
But there was also already a recognition that I was 'off' in some way
and that no matter how dutifully I followed the recipe so helpfully written out for me, I would never be the product it was meant to create.
So better to reject entirely, yeah?
But that didn't last because, unfortunate as it is to admit, beauty if fun.
Putting colourful sparkles on your eyelids and painting your fingernails is fun.
If my body is the blank canvas I was born with, is it not okay to add some colour?
'Self-expression' it's called
But then the other part of my brain raises an eyebrow and wonders why sparkles and hairlessness and long nails are fun at all.
Who told me that feeling 'feminine' means freshly shaved legs and a mani-pedi?
Who or what told me this is what I need to do to express myself?
That self-expression is a wholly aesthetic endeavour.

Was this how women are meant to be? Is this what beauty just 'is'?
Or was it cosmetic companies ensuring future sales and a loyal clientele by selling an impossible narrative of beauty to women?
I'm not the first to say this and I won't be the last, but it's still so pervasive it deserves to be shared.
How many women have to have the epiphany that everything they do to feel beautiful and feminine was made up by some company who just wants their money.
Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi said money is psychic energy.
How much of my life energy, through my thought



first draft here: [[My Body Is Not The Project - baby's first crack]]
# my body is not the project: reflections on control - outline

- what is beauty? what is control? are they the same thing? needing some level of control for wellbeing. my beauty lived experience.
- my history (body shame, not good enough, failed woman, rejecting beauty because I knew I couldn't live up to it)
	- naomi wolf - aspiring woman
	- entanglement - standards are suffocating, social media experience, tv, media, environment controls life
	- even in dance class watching others. Always would pick out the most beautiful to me and watch her. artist, only painted/drew beautiful girls, designer, creating beauty. I am obsessed with beauty. feels like drugs in my brain. beautiful things are good for the soul
- why is it like this? is it true classical conditioning or operant conditioning? 
	- self expression as aesthetic only? where does it come from?
	- james hamlin in clean talks of innate desire of beauty for beauty's sake
	- hypercommercial self expression - prada perfume commercial - always different but always myself
	- innate desire for beauty? (indg 101 - beautiful things good for the soul - made functional objects beautiful)
	- media, money, distraction, amounts spent on beauty, money is psychic energy. keeping you distracted with time at work and time in leisure purchasing. (ultimate end of person is to buy things meaning of things). the rites of beauty as moral obligation.
- how could this happen to me though? I'm smart? - it's that pervasive. did not realize that women actually need certain level of fat to be healthy. did not know leg/belly fat is for baby brain/corneas. if all you know is popular media you think you desperately need to lose weight not and become super skinny and it's a personal flaw or shame or wrong you have done to not achieve this, all due to your own discipline.
	- control as intelligence - IQ is measure of self control. control as civilization. beyond aesthetics
	- control as godliness - emaciated body for god, control is morality, worth as person to civilization (capitalism). control as combat, power over material world. trying to evade death.
	- deprive of pleasure is control. real enlightened/smart people are above pleasure. pleasure is to be ashamed of. enjoying food is gross hedonism. ultimate aim of civilization is denying all bodily pleasures and reaching self control.
- ultimate self control - eating disorder/starving - taking up as little space/as little impact as possible. I am the cruel master of my body.
	- the thing about eating disorders is that they work - feeling like I fit in, feeling like my body is a statement saying fuck you look at me, body as achievement. look what I can do. 
	- still didn't feel beautiful, afraid to show my body because feels like screaming for attention. feels like saying fuck you to others and making them jealous/look bad.
	- health issues - no period,  no feelings, cannot get attached to it because deep down i knew it wasn't healthy so uncomfortable being seem as attractive (if i'm not attractive i'm not doing enough, if I am attractive it's just cause i'm doing so much duality - like beauty myth cannot win calling you beautiful or not).
	- brain space taken up with concern over food - vigilance trying to maintain weight, control of food, going to restaurant is stressful because out of my norm/control. only want what is expected.
- once you have control what do you do? take a walk by yourself? - the isolation of control in social life. extreme control means you cannot handle uncertainty, cannot do things on the fly, cannot 
	- my most conventionally attractive self couldn't walk across the convocation mall, no energy to be social/handle uncertainty, barely alive. 
	- you need to be social - cannot handle entropy if sedated, isolation makes it worse, cycle repeats - pushing myself away so people don't notice/mess up my control
	- control as obsessive narcissism/overactive default mode network - excessive self-reflection/focus - part of growing up is not being narcissist anymore and zooming out into world. stunting growth. limiting self from being happy, this is something I can do/control as replacement/distraction from what I cant
- need to zoom out/transcend, see that it's irrelevant, everything is overproduced
	- relationship where I was not coming in as 100%, could not handle uncertainty and diet difference, too sedated to show up for it fully, don't feel sexy or like a woman, feel like a child because my body was that of a girl
	- ability to be flexible, eat out, not have to plan meals in advance and constantly keep tally of if I ate too much and how much to not eat to counteract, freeing up brain space and making me less stressed when being social, ability to go with the flow, shake the snowglobe, handle entropy
	- listening to 'how to change your mind' about transcendent experiences, allows you to see world at large, not just parts â€“ it's irrelevant, it simply did not matter anymore
	- my body is not the project. my projects are the project. my music, my ceramics, my art, this. only so much brain space, what do I want to be my contribution? you can't take it with you, but you also can't leave it behind. when i'm dead my body will rot in the ground but my music will exist in the world if streaming still exists and everything hasn't burned down by then.
	- my body is not the project. my life is.

- perceptual salience


control?

the meaning of things
- money is psychic energy
- everything is translation of sun's energy
- useless art as new invention (professional beauty is next step)
the beauty myth
- beauty standards from porn - why would I dress as demeaned object of male desire?
- starving is an excellent sedative
- prospective woman
how to change your mind 
- addiction is extreme narcissism
- too much rigidity = eating disorders. need balance of entropy and structure
- surrender control to transcend
- everything is overproduced, here and now is what's real
- intellectually knowing there is beauty is not the same as seeing it
eve
- need fat on thighs and belly to make baby brain and corneas. collect rare fats over a lifetime for this.
love, sex and tragedy
- the emaciated body is godly, pure, good
- sacrifice all pleasures to be godly
- Eros destroys civilization, self-control is ultimate aim of civilization
psyc 260
- environment controls our life
- beauty/attraction is the most important element of attraction. unavoidably important
- perceptions of beauty are shared worldwide
social
- self control is a limited resource
- self control feels like source of power
- society values self control more than it values quality of life
requiem for the american dream
- polarized society is easier to control
- acquisition of new material objects, don't look beyond
your body is not an apology
- default body as means of control
- body terrorism takes away your power
- $15,000 spent on beauty products over average US woman's lifetime. talk about waste of energy and money (time/energy to achieve money means women are kept busy with work and preoccupied with beauty in leisure)
- humans are masters of distraction - use beauty/aesthetics as a distraction from harder/greater things
the medusa and the snail
- health obsession as means of control/evading death/coping out of solving actual problems
- control and then what? talk to yourself? destroy everything and then?
big leap
- we constrain our own happiness/achievement to remain where it is sfe
the body
- professional beauty
principles of art
- Collingwood asserts "the words 'Beauty,' 'beautiful', as actually used, have no aesthetic implication... They express an attitude of admiration for a thing well done, irrespective of whether that thing is an aesthetic activity, an intellectual activity, or a bodily activity." (p39)



other
- need control to be happy
- two red stripes on the popsicle sticl





Is it worth being sedated?
The pursuit of 'beauty', I guess, whatever that means, is an excellent distraction.
but from what?
what am I running from?





How do you escape a lifetime of indoctrination? 
Women are delicate. Women are petite. Women are
