## Intentions
### Objective
- pottery/creative output branding that's more true to me now, a bit edgier and more grown up but still childish
- can expand past ceramics - silkscreen, art print, stickers, 
- not so confined to parrots which I don't super identify with anymore
### Details
- logo is heart with eyes (lol)
- I would like to keep hand drawn graphics
### Questions
- do I keep graphics I have now? Just add more? Do I change it up?
- Do I change photography style? What do I want it to look like/mean?
- will more fun/edgy branding alienate current customers? 
- who is my target audience?
- do I make this my 'art' identity or limit it to ceramics?
### Point
- more aligned with my identity now, not as bird-centric, more room for growth
- new business cards, thank you cards, stickers, colours, type, visuals for instagram (post once a week? at least when i'm making stuff)
- more aligned with vision for ceramics in future
## Actions
### Tasks
- stickers for brand graphics
- new business cards
