central site gathering all my stuff together
- mytakeaway (input and output)
- portfolio
- viaviaandtheband
- etsy

- somewhere to post stuff
- does this make sense?

yes i want mytakeaway online still - add
## todo
- [ ] look at other diverse portfolios
	- what do they include?
	- navigation?
	- framing?
	- organization of different content
	- responsiveness - what do they do for this?

- React and Next.js - this is what I need to learn to take my projects to the next level

## Portfolio Research
### What I like
- projects and thoughts division
- grid columns - pick one and work with it
- space
- big and small type contrast
- bright colours used sparingly
- random interactive elements
	- random mantra/advice generator? click and gives something
- movement, parallax, gifs
	- simple sketch/doodle gif
	- transforming from text to imagery gif
- unique hover states
- extreme pragmaticism and minimalism - interest not excess
- smooth scroll, sticky menu
- vintage video effect
- def have gifs and graphics
- next project at bottom of page
- custom cursors
- direction at the top
- background changing colour as you scroll
- 
### What I dislike
- gratuitous bright colours
- all white
- very basic grid of projects
- pretentious mission statement "designer and disruptor multidisciplinary inventor of world shattering multi reality experiences"
- hard to use
	- the cursor becomes arrow to click through gallery
	- weird scroll down effects

## What I am trying to convey
- creative
- multidisciplinary
- prolific
- curious
- strong visual design 
## What I would like
- highlight colour changes with colour gradient - how to do this?
	- if i do colour gradient
- gif of changing things for O in olivia
- white/black switch for fun
- hover gives preview of the work
	- dumbcute stickers
	- hypnopompic eyes blinking
	- healthconnect app interface interaction - if I keep this
	- SUI gif? for SAP
- OR hover shows gif that tells what kind of project it is
- title also switching colours??
- colour change drop shadow?
- sun moon colour change
- links a different colour?

## Visual Qualities
Some Trends  
- collage grunge  
- humanized digital  
- light touch typography  
- ==anti design design porn  ==
- saturation clash  
- visual mindfulness (space)  
- light edge  
- pragmatic disclosure - to the point 
- playful malaise

## Learned from Anna
- make imagery just for portfolio 
	- mockups to show work
	- banner
	- showing process and design systems
- headings as statements
- designed experience


## Functional Requirements - code
- dark/light mode switch
	- css custom properties
	- prefers-color-scheme toggle
		- light, dark, system preference
- responsiveness
- semantic html
	- decide h levels and tags
- oliviaworld scrolls up when scroll, gif goes away when stops moving
## Functional Requirements -  design
- O switching gif - how to make it look cool though
- scroll down gif
- gif video of me waving or something?
- gifs/imagery for hover
- mockups/showcase for each project

















- connector between different microsites
- microsite artist, anything can be a medium of expression
- potentially a different design for each project - just a bunch of design porn
- motion elements
- treatment of imagery for case
- is the design the project? I guess?
	- tradeoff between content and design?










- **artistspace** - writing and artistic personal pursuits 
	- my body is not the project
	- dumbcute
	- viavia and the band
- **my takeaway** - inputs from books and media, potentially summary 
- **case studies/portfolio** - portfolio projects
	- planning video
	- between dreams and reality
	- runitup?
	- healthconnect?
	- ABH help research project, diagram guidelines, interface gifs
