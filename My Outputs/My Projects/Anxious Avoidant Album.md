## Concept
- it's a breakup album
- about social connections
- commitment, impermanence
- wanting it to work more than you want them
- also lol cause i'm **mostly** avoidant and elliot is anxious


## Visual
- album cover is me holding mugshot sign with 'anxious avoidant' - guilty as charged?
- white space
- grunge

- laying on the grass ground next to someone but i'm sitting up

## Tracklist
- all to myself
- mindfuck!
- here for you
- it's not fair
- people like you
- stay with me
- were you real?
- stuck with me




maybe
- I could be
- honest type
- safe in my memory
