## Idea
- what I learned from differences between work and school
- what I like better about work, how to implement that into school

- ==what's different between work and school, prepare for work by implementing this in school - also like it better ==

## [[Project start checklist]]
Capture current thinking brain dump - only 20-30 minutes, just to get idea of start

# being proactive - real world design

- catered to design students or more general?
- reasons I find work more fulfilling, how to translate into school too

- **highlight differences between work and school and how to navigate them/prepare for them when you are in school/get more out of uni by implementing these behaviours and attitudes**

differences between university and work 

- relationships - you work ongoing with coworkers
	- do not see others as obstacles or competition
	- build relationships over time, working together consistently
	- give positive feedback/depend on each other
- build relationships with profs/classmates - see them as coworkers, equals not above or below you

- work - relationships. 
	- uni I never put too much effort into learning about profs/tas/classmates because I knew I'd probably never see them again after 4 months. 
	- at work you are working with people every day, helpful to have relationships with them
	- always wondered why I had poor collaboration - it's because of lack of connection. very easy to work with people once you know and are comfortable with them
		- feel more motivated to do the work

- success criteria - in uni you know exactly what they want, at work nobody does
	- it is up to you to figure out the success criteria for a project, ask questions and see on varying levels of detail
	- uni it's isolated learning exercise, work it means things to people/has repercussions - the better you understand those, the better your work/understanding will be

- what is rewarded - uni a lot of the time it's novelty or following specific steps
	- work doesn't matter how you get there so long as you do
	- you can ask for help - in both, why not?
	- work needs to fit into company brand and standards - working within constraints, uni often you are starting from scratch so can call all the shots
	- work is longterm, uni only has to stay together until presentation - think longer term than project deadline or even work term - your contributions will live on

- respect and value - uni you are the student, you default to prof or TA, at work you are hired to do a job so are expected to have the expertise - led to one of my mantras "be the designer"
	- they are trusting you to make decisions
	- as long as you can explain your design decisions it's all good
	- people can disagree - you can both defend and let go your ideas

- work - uni assigned exactly, work you have to be proactive and see opportunities or you might have not enough to do
	- not very interesting/exciting when you are bored
	- make opportunities for yourself
	- uni may not be interested, work you can listen to what others are doing and just get involved/insert yourself in areas that interest you

- scaffolding - uni is structured learning, work you have to structure your own learning path 
	- not in someone else's learning framework 
	- what do you want to learn?
	- not just working but developing too
		- development comes from projects and reflection
		- also taking advantage of resources, sharpening the saw
			- in uni all your doing is sharpening the saw, at work you can get carried away in the day-to-day work and not develop towards goals
			- uni you trust you are on a path and can get lost in the weeds without worrying about bigger picture (at least me)

- level of effort - doing everything to an A is wasted effort, prioritize
	- what is most important task for others?
	- what will help you learn/grow most?
	- what is fine as good enough?
	- you only have so many hours and so much energy, what is actually important?

- learning for retention not regurgitation - uni learn, have test, forget, work you are expected to remember
	- good pkm strategy sooner than later - meetings, notes, projects - centralized place to keep all this information so you aren't asking the same questions over and over again or forgetting what people said/what you have to do

- growth is important in both, facilitate learning in both
- **work for the growth not the paycheque - uni for growth not grades**
	- this is an opportunity, do you take as much as you can from it or get distracted by fake value and ignore opportunities and lessons
		- real value is learning, nobody can take that from you, that makes you valuable in future career or learning pursuits
		- money and grades are transient

- biggest takeaways from working
	- mentor said take yourself seriously and other people will - (don't give them another reason to discount you as a young woman in tech)
	- be the designer - uni you are following someone else's agenda, work you are making your own, you are autonomous and responsible for your output level and amount
		- be proactive at getting involved
		- take 100% responsibility
		- active not passive
	- take advantage of resources - people and other
