- essay exploring how I feel about sexuality
- I do not feel like a sexual being
- so so so much shame 
- being hit on/romantic doesn't feel like anything
- I want romance but sex feels uncomfortable and gross
- I am still a child - stunted?
- maybe I don't need to look back for the approval of the secure base - differentiation, I need to be a distinct person not an offshoot
- discomfort being hit on/seen as attractive - it feels like being used
- i feel so young and naive (because I am)
