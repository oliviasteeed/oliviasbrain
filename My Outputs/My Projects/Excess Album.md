### Excesses
- romantic - dating apps, always something better
- food - overeating is normalized, junk food, overconsumption of sugar/salt/fat
- work - overworking, giving all to work and no energy for anything else
- body - working out/starving to achieve unrealistic standards? plastic surgery? excess because waste of resources for a pursuit with no tangible end goal/value
- makeup/cosmetics/aesthetics - money and time spent on superficial falsity, doesn't achieve anything tangible so why
- consumerism - need more to be satisfied but it's never enough
- media - so much content to consume you could spend the rest of your life passively watching
- money - aspirations to be rich, have more than others
- power/control - pushing others down
- fame - being watched/admired/envied by others, existing as greater than your mortal body
- cars - personal comfort at the expense of everyone's public transit resources/experience and environmental costs
- friendships - a lot of shallow connections to appear popular, fear of vulnerability and realness
- social media - time wasted, energy spent on curating life image that's bullshit and we all know it. creating a fake reality
- casual sex - excess of hedonistic pleasure at cost of real connection or self worth
- content economy - fighting for attention
- fanciness/class aspirations - excess for its own sake and because it shows you're 'better' than others
- clothes - the need to self express/buy identity through money
- university/education - a lot of time wasted, not in it for the right reasons, just to get a certification, not the actual learning so it's wasted/excessive
- self expression - that we think we're entitled to feel like we are truly ourselves and can express ourselves/pursue passions/interests at the cost of world's resources and needs/needs of others
- narcissism - excessive self importance
- drugs/alcohol - consciousness is a burden to escape, the snake eating its own tail
- partying/clubbing - paying money to be hedonistic and for the chance to be hit on
- news/media - exaggeration/constant content excess, we do not need this much
- internetness - the internet is full we can all do something else now
- mental health - no struggle so brain attacks itself, labels for excuse, pulling others into the void with you, stewing in negativity
- complacency

- in nature there is no excess
