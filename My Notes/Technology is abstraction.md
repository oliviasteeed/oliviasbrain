## Concept
- technology abstracts our connections to production, community, and interests of society
- abstracts creation - used to be tangible goods and [[When the ends exist, the means have ceased to exist.]], technology means things are never truly tangible and never finished
- [[Abstraction is beauty]] - this is why we worship technology
## Questions/Connections/Thoughts
- mental impacts of nothing ever being 'done'? differences in work effort? 
	- agile development approach over artist one and done method - impacts on mindset? quality? cultural norms?
