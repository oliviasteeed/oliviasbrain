### Concept
- **Capture**: only what is noteworthy
	- what do you need? 
	- keep only what resonates, hits you on emotional level
	- turn up the volume on your intuition
- **Organize**: for action in projects you are working on right now
	- clear filter for ignoring irrelevant information
	- only keep what is necessary for your projects
- **Distill**: notice patterns between ideas
	- every note is seed of idea
	- distill notes down to their essence to make faster connections
	- "how can I make this as useful as possible for my future self?"
- **Express**: no point if you aren't making outputs
	- translate and apply knowledge into action
	- do not fall into trap of consumption safety
	- information becomes knowledge after you put it to use
	- creating > consuming - spend as much time as possible creating
	- express to make an impact on what matters to you
