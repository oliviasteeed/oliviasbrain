## Concept
- when mental health issues were less normalized they were less common. Is this because they were undiagnosed or because now that they are people just assume they have them/the brain adapts to fit those scripts of normalcy?
- we have compulsion to act in accordance with [[Normalcy]] - even subconsciously we mirror people's behaviours and wording
- [[Mirror neurons]] - giving us practice acting how others act
## Questions/Connections/Thoughts
- when I thought it was inevitable/normal to be a victim I was, it was a genuine epiphany moment when I realized it was a possibility to exist as a functional, mentally well person. Doesn't mean I don't have lows, but that they don't mean I am mentally unwell, just part of normal emotional variation
- [[Emotions are a storm that will pass]] v. [[Emotions are inevitable]] mindset
