## Concept
- norms are created by companies that always want you to buy more so it figures
- also created by media that idealizes life - meaning everyone is rich
## Questions/Connections/Thoughts
- feelings of inadequacy? do we fill the void with more shopping to try to reach standards?
- I think we really want power/status and material goods are red herring keeping us from it instead of bringing us closer like we expect
