## Concept
- before photography, people only knew of the human body what they saw in the day to day
- photography allowed systematic analysis and documentation of "normal" within a population
- photos of athletic/beautiful as objects of admiration and inspiration - gave hope that this was attainable to anyone

- the ideal woman was created by photography - capturing and sharing small window of femininity as what a womenâ€“all womenâ€“should be
