I feel the urge to socialize and then draw back before I reach out - but why? Why not just reach out like it's no big deal? And so I will. I am capable of it. I do not have to be confined to an old shy or awkward identity. Being social and outgoing is a thing you can just do like it's no big deal because it's not. Just treat it like it's whatever and it is. [[You create your reality]]
