## Concept
- we assume the actions of others are due to internal factors 
- we justify our own actions as due to internal factors

- happens because we want to feel some sense of control over our actions
- we understand our circumstances/context more than others when making judgments
- we assume what we can see is the action object in a situation and cannot see ourselves
