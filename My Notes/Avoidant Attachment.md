### Concept
- inconsistent attention and love as a child manifests in distrust and need for distance in adult relationships
- avoidance developed for survival in harsh environments - needed to be more self-centered with limited resources
- avoidants are suppressed anxious that use distance to cope, keep intellectual distance and escape route in relationships
- avoidants are harsher on partners, undercut kind/positive actions to deactivate attachment system
#### Deactivating strategies
- being harsh on partner to create distance
- longing for the phantom ex (feelings of love return because threat of intimacy is gone and only remember positives)
- looking for the one - nobody is quite good enough
#### Advice for avoidant
- happiness only real when shared
- stop assuming there is someone better out there and appreciate what you have
