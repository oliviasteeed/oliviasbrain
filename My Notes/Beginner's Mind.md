## Concept
- start from pure childlike place
- see things as they actually are
- assume we know nothing
- the impossible becomes accessible when we do not know the limits - barricade of knowledge
- be radically honest, pure authenticity
- play above all else
- the present is all there is
- needs as a creator come first - inspiration takes precedence over all other behaviours
- strip away labels - they limit before you even start
- experience everything like the first time
- see the extraordinary in the mundane
