> "just accept yourself - even your mental illness"
- the whole point of diagnosis is to identify the problem to attempt to remedy
- no you shouldn't accept your mental illness - that's falling into a [[Victim mindset]]
- don't hate yourself for it but [[Taking 100% responsibility is the first step to improving]] - don't be complacent, be proactive
