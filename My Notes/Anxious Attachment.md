### Concept
- 3 attachment styles in close relationships, influenced by parents and life experience

- **Secure Attachment** - feel comfortable with intimacy and warm and loving
- **[[Anxious Attachment]]** - crave intimacy, worried other will not reciprocate
- **[[Avoidant Attachment]]** - avoid intimacy as loss of independence, minimize closeness

- we are bred to attach to significant other
	- those who formed intimate bonds survived
	- the brain has attachment system mechanism just to keep us close to loved ones
	- proximity to loved ones is survival necessity
- we exhibit protest behaviours as children when attachment system is not satisfied - still shown in adulthood
	- anxious: trying to get closer
	- avoidant: trying to distance
- feeling unfulfilled/attached to partner creates constant low level tension in relationship
