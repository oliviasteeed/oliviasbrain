life is so fucking good when you aren't restricting
- not cold all the time
- feeling better about my body????
- i have an ass and thighs
- not tired/lightheaded and barely hanging on by next meal - less rigid schedule
- my clothes fit
- more energetic in workouts, lifting heavier
- able to enjoy food 
- not nervous when eating more/different than usual
- energy to be outgoing all the time???? didn't even know that was an option??
