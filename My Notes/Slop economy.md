## Concept
- [[Content]]-based economy where everything is created to meet existing demands so nothing new gets made 
- proliferated by AI - making things from what already exists puts a limit on innovation
- no risks, no art, nobody really believes in what they are making - it's just to pay the bills/what has to be done
- sedated/seduced by ego porn of what we already know 
## Questions/Connections/Thoughts
- do people even care? do we want innovation or are we so comfortable with the known that it now seems unappealing
- more slop
