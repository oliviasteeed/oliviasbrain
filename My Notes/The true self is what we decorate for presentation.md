## Concept
- tribes in highland Papua New Guinea consider aesthetic decoration the true self over the body you have by chance
> "for the New Guinea highlander it is not the "natural" physiognomy that one merely happens to be born with that reveals the self, but the self that is constructed through the labour of self-decoration. For them it is obvious that the true self is what one constructs not merely fortuitously starts." (p44). 
- Comparable to Western shopping, wherein a shopper decides what kind of person they are, and what self they want to reinforce, through their show choices. 
## Questions/Connections/Thoughts
- This is really interesting because it goes against feminist statements that the true self is the body you were born in. Even people living a more 'natural' life have high value on self-decoration so I guess the consumerist mess we are in now was inevitable? Because who am I? My body that I was born with by chance or the things I spend my money and time on? 
- This also goes into classism where certain 'selves' are only accessible through money.
