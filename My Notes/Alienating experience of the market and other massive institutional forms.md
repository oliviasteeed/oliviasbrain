## Concept
- massive institutions make us feel powerless and deindividuated
- false belief that we combat this by expressing individuality - this actually leads to more alienation
- actually combatted by trying to fit in as proxy for belonging and relationships - feeling like something greater than yourself 
## Questions/Connections/Thoughts
- more than just trendy shopping - church, music, university, work can all be forms of higher belonging
