## Concept
- looking for escape route and always being one foot out steals immediacy and fullness of experience
- prevents you from taking responsibility for yourself/actions/wellbeing in the moment - forgetting that [[You create your reality]]
- present in lack of commitment to self and actualization like in [[When Things Fall Apart]]
- present in relationships - especially when you have [[Avoidant Attachment]]
