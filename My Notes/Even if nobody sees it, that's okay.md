## Concept
- concept of flower growing in crack between rocks - beautiful even if nobody sees it
- life does not have to exist for purposes of performance
> "If you can live your life without an audience, you should do it." -Bo Burnham
- cultivating intrinsic motivation, questioning motivations and where desire for something is coming from if vision of success contains mainly external reward and recognition - [[Do I want it or do they want me to want it?]]
## Questions/Connections/Thoughts
- freedom is not needing to be seen?
- but we literally need to be socially seen and recognized to want to survive
