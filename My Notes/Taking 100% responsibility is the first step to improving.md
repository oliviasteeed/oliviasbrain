## Concept
- [[You create your reality]] - let this resonate to stop running and blaming others, you only have yourself to blame 
- this is empowering - it means you are in control and don't have to wait for anything/anyone to come save/fix you
- forgive yourself immediately, figure out what you can do now to be better next time
