you cannot just consume continuously, you get less and less clear. the more you let it simmer and write it down the lighter you feel
- like writing in a journal feels like a cleansing but i rarely know what i'm going to write before i start writing
- is it art then? - [[The artist has no idea what the experience is which demands expression until he has expressed it]]
