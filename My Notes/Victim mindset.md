## Concept
- the opposite of [[Taking 100% responsibility is the first step to improving]] and [[You create your reality]]
- relegating control to someone else (even if nobody else is actually in control) - too much shame to admit you are in control and you did a bad job - release control to reduce [[Cognitive Dissonance]] 
- immaturity - wanting a parent to step in and fix it for you
