## Things to work on:
### self confidence
- feeling worthy of someone actually liking me
- not just being amazed someone doesn't leave/expecting them to leave
- feeling worthy of someone else
- not being embarrassed of being vulnerable
- not being ashamed to show i like them
- not being ashamed/downplaying what i do
- being able to take compliments 
### assertiveness
- feeling comfortable making decisions and sharing my opinions with other people
- being able to make the plans
- being able to choose the restaurant
- being able to navigate
- no learned helplessness to combat insecurity and fear of being seen as overbearing/bossy/narcissistic
- initiating intimacy
### proactiveness
- showing i care about someone
- words of affirmation
- doing little things for them/to win them over instead of being insecure and assuming they don't want me so putting in least effort to avoid embarrassing myself
- making them feel equally seen
### intimacy and sexuality
- deal with intense sexual shame
- body image issues: i cannot fathom myself as attractive or sexy or if i am it's just through starving history and they wouldn't like me if i hadn't lost weight
- issue taking control or being assertive because i don't want to do it wrong (wtf are you doing) and be embarrassed (this would make my soul shrivel up)
- find out what i am actually into/what i want 
- experience sexual pleasure without shame blocking me
- get my period/be a full woman
