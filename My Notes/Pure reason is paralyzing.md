## Concept
- need positivity/creativity to make decisions and take chances. Striving for objectivity is so overwhelming to be paralyzing
- steals trust in intuition - [[Building a Second Brain]] must trust your intuition to know what is relevant of [[CODE Method]] capture step
- we seek out [[Myth of objectivity]] to simplify complexity but it is maladaptive because it creates a framework we cannot live up to

## Questions/Connections/Thoughts
- this is how I feel in design - there is so much to know that how can I make any decision "correctly" - also there is no objective "correct" so anything I do could be called wrong and justifiably so
- over-reliance on user research instead of having a clear vision for what you are trying to do and using that to refine product
