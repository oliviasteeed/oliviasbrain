## Concept
- Gabor Mate Myth of Normal - belief that we are discrete individuals with private goals robs us of connectedness we need to be fulfilled

- capitalism mindset - individual worker vs work
- consumerism - it's all in your hands, just buy more
- productivity culture - your goals alone take priority, you are in control and only need yourself to be fulfilled
- individualism - fight and win against others, overvaluing "freedom"
