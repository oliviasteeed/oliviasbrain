## Notes
To write persuasively include:
- **Burning problem**Â â€“ imply or state a problem they want to solve.
- **Desirable goal**Â â€“ preferably a goal from your vision so you can attract people like you (those who you can help most).
- **Path to bridge the gap**Â â€“ from personal experience, your system to achieve that goal.

- Writing is how you synthesize ideas into something tangible
- build community off of personal brand so you can pivot to whatever you want
