## Notes
Rhaina Cohen - The Other Significant Others Book - friends as lovers

> "the most beautiful, rewarding, and transformative experiences in life transcend the categories our culture has created to contain the chaos of consciousness, nowhere more so than in the realm of relationships — those mysterious benedictions that bridge the abyss between one consciousness and another"

> "It takes both great courage and great vulnerability to live outside concepts, to meet each new experience, each new relationship, each new emotional landscape on its own terms and let it in turn expand the terms of living."

> "other significant others.” Having eschewed a more typical life setup, these friends confront hazards and make discoveries they wouldn’t have otherwise."
- friends as lovers

> "found themselves in finding each other."

> "It can be confusing to live in the gulf between the life you have and the life you believe you’re supposed to be living."


How to Write About Nature and Alice in Wonderland
> "we too are living in a wonderland, as real as it is improbable, for nowhere else across the inky vastness of spacetime strewn with billions upon billions of other star systems is there another world lush with life, as far as we yet know."
- awe

> "Those writers who have gotten humanity to care about the natural world — which is the world — have done so because they themselves have moved through it with a sense of wonder"

> "creatures “driven by desires the opposite of personal” and free from “ethical ambivalence or regret” — those marvelous, maddening complexities that make for the human drama."

> With a wild animal character, there is only ever a point A: the animal is what it is and was and always will be. For there to be a point B, a destination for a dramatic journey, only a human character will suffice."

> "Carson’s credo that “the more clearly we can focus our attention on the wonders and realities of the universe about us the less taste we shall have for the destruction of our race,”

> "reverence for life"

> "caring is contagious"

> "If there is poetry in my book about the sea, she said at the ceremony where she shared a table with the poet Marianne Moore, it is not because I deliberately put it there, but because no one could write truthfully about the sea and leave out the poetry." - Rachel Carson

Maira Kalmon - Living with Remorse

> "Perhaps one day this too will be snatched from us, but for now there seems to be one tumult of being pulsating in the human breast alone: the capacity to be sorry, to feel the soul-ache of remorse as the penitent past fangs the flesh of the present."
- special human capacity for remorse

> "When trying to understand why human beings do what they do, a fog descends."

> "Your family.  
My family.  
Your remorse.  
My remorse.  
All the same, right?  
Vast skies full of remorse.  
Oceans of remorse.  
But enough.  
There should be merriment.  
And good cheer.  
Good tidings. Well wishing.  
Tables laden with food.  
Children playing.  
Gathering of kinfolk.  
Like Clara would have wanted.  
Seeing the best.  
Forgiving the worst.  
If there is remorse,  
let there be a limit to remorse.  
A way to shake off the heavy weight.  
But how can we make this happen?  
How to do this?  
Dark is life.  
Spring is here.  
The birds are singing.  
In the strangeness of life, LIVE." - Maira Kalmon
