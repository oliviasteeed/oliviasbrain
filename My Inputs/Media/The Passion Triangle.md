## Notes
Passion Triangle 
- thrill - excitement, interest, attraction (what falling in love feels like) - this can last if you intentionally keep it in mind, always there under routine
- intimacy - deep sense of knowing and being known, vulnerability, sharing every part of yourself knowing you will be accepted no matter what - keep this by paying mindful attention to them as if still in initial infatuation, they are not responsible for your happiness
- sensuality - romantic/erotic connection (from hand holding to sex), starts adventurous and exciting but can get routine if you are not intentional about it

Become an "awakened lover"
> "As an awakened lover, you connect with your five physical senses and the sixth sense, which is your mind, in new and powerfully erotic ways in the service of sensuality."
- *embodied experience*

> ""Holding eye contact brings erotic intensity" 
- *eye contact is sex*

> "It takes intimacy to make soul-shaking love and to trust that you can play in the dark depths of your raw desire."

- keep courting each other indefinitely
