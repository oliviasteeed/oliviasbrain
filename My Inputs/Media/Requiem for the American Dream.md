## Notes
- The 60's contained a lot of liberation and rights movements, and the government and businesses reacted with a coordinated effort to reduce liberty and democracy in the 70's onwards.

- Marketing commodities only appears in 'free' nations. It is a covert kind of control to keep people focused only on the acquisition of new material objects, and the money that requires. People on the treadmill are too distracted to question or fight.Â _But if you don't engage with consumerism so many locations and activities are useless. You're not as fun._

- After the second world war, a poorer society payed for soldiers (most of the population) to have free university. Now, in a richer society it's somehow unaffordable for the government to subsidize university completely. It's not about cost, it's about controlling access.

- Businesses are regarded as 'persons' under US law, so you can't legally do something that would hurt a business.Â _Feels like businesses have more rights than people._

- For businesses, spending money is considered 'speech,' so businesses must be allowed to spend money however they want in accordance with free speech.

- Large businesses make most of their revenue from moving money around, not producing goods or contributing anything to society.

- The US government has an obligation to bail out large businesses and banks when they lose billions of dollars, and put the burden of payment on taxpayers. Meanwhile, large businesses pay almost no taxes.

- People become polarized and angry at each other as a result of wealth inequality instead of fighting the common opponent of large businesses.Â _This is likely because individuals cannot make an impact on policy or business regulation, so punch down to where they can exert control._

- The business of the United States is business. Money equals power, which leads to regulation to make more money.
