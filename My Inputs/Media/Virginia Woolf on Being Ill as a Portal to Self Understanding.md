## Notes
- body is a distraction or pet
> “The body provides something for the spirit to look after and use,” computing pioneer Alan Turing wrote as he contemplated [the binary code of body and spirit](https://themarginalian.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=13eb080d8a315477042e0d5b1&id=2f9baaefc0&e=fd265d8594) in the spring of his twenty-first year, having just lost the love of his life to tuberculosis.

> literature does its best to maintain that its concern is with the mind; that the body is a sheet of plain glass through which the soul looks straight and clear, and, save for one or two passions such as desire and greed, is null, and negligible and non-existent.

- the body is a cage we cannot escape until death
> The creature within can only gaze through the pane — smudged or rosy; it cannot separate off from the body like the sheath of a knife or the pod of a pea for a single instant; it must go through the whole unending procession of changes, heat and cold, comfort and discomfort, hunger and satisfaction, health and illness, until there comes the inevitable catastrophe; the body smashes itself to smithereens, and the soul (it is said) escapes.

We do not know our own souls, let alone the souls of others. Human beings do not go hand in hand the whole stretch of the way. There is a virgin forest in each; a snowfield where even the print of birds’ feet is unknown. Here we go alone, and like it better so. Always to have sympathy, always to be accompanied, always to be understood would be intolerable.
- always to be understood would be intolerable - joy of being misunderstood, you get to keep some for you

- illness brings you back to awe direct perception. appreciating the sky
> This then has been going on all the time without our knowing it!

- the lowgrade tension of knowing the randomness and coldness of the universe
> Divinely beautiful it is also divinely heartless. Immeasurable resources are used for some purpose which has nothing to do with human pleasure or human profit.
- there are other goals than human pleasure or human profit

- lack of clear meaning is freedom and meaning - we make beauty to feel like the universe means something
> the paradoxical way in which these heartless laws are the very reason we are called to make beauty and meaning within their unfeeling parameters: “There is no Shakespeare, there is no Beethoven; certainly and emphatically there is no God; we are the words; we are the music; we are the thing itself,” she would write in 1939.
