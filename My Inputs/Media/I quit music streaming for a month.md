### Questions/Connections/Thoughts

## Notes
- less skipping, less phone distraction, more experiencing album as one unit

- there is a lot of formless media - no physical presence, what is legacy of this?

- past physical or no physical, never was, never meant to have one - concert footage on youtube? mixes? videogame soundtracks? even streaming exclusive music is in some ways formless

- beyond category or context - just is, no longer has place to live
