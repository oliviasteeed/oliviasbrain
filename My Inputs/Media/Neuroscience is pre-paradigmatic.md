## Notes
- brain is not made of discrete parts doing discrete things
> There is now well-documented ‚Äúrepresentational drift‚Äù wherein parts of the brain shift what they respond to, not just at a timescale of days, but at a timescale of minutes.

- brain is a black box
- replication crisis also with neuroimaging studies, nobody thinks in averages
- consciousness is the primary function of the brain
- consciousness interprets and recalls more than studies show (remember faces seem in crowd when were searching for one face)
- people lie in studies - how do we knoe results are true?
