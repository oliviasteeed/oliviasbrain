## Humour is a skill you can build
> "The most important lesson I learned is that 80% of humor is just understanding, memorizing, and applying humor first principles. The last 20% comes with integrating them together and creating your own humor style. So by learning the most important humor principles and applying them, you can become vastly funnier without a massive amount of effort."

- things are funny because they are unexpected but familiar - make us feel smart/seen/on the inside
## Conversation is about relation
- answer questions with jumping off points for future questions
- don't be boring! just share whatever
## Learn to tell good stories
- start stories with action and location
- why are we listening to you?
## To come true to others you must first come true to yourself
- who are you man?
## Confidence is something you do, not something you feel
- [[You create your reality]]
- remember a time you were super confident - channel that
- good posture and smile goes a long way
