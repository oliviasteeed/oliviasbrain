## Notes
Peter Principle - everyone rises to the level of their incompetence, everyone in a company is operating at mediocre level because they've been promoted out of their best skillset
- difference between art and capitalism

> "The problems that you correctly understand are the ones that you fix. The ones that you incorrectly understand will stay unfixable."

- half of the battle is diagnosing the problem correctly

> "something being really important to ypu makes it much harder to succeed" - failing at it will be crushing
- make it less important - then you don't feel crushing defeat. you can't change external circumstances as much as internal

When we value things we have no experience with:
- we construct fantasies of unrealistic expectations - when someone doesn't live up to them it feels like -50/100 not +50
- makes you more stressed - unattractive and not present
- harms other person who cannot live up to fantasy

- natural organicness to relationships if you aren't obsessed with them - nothing on dating apps is predictor of relationship success, one of them is shared emotional experience when first meeting

- value it less - then it's not so earth-shatteringly important

- reflect on who you are in a relationship 

- having low self esteem means you filter out everyone who is 'too good for you' and only try for people not emotionally healthy enough to date - so of course all your experiences are bad

- yes work on yourself but a large part of growing self esteem is corrective social experiences - you need people, don't wait until you are 'fixed'
- most people with BPD will be in remissiom after 10 years - just one positive relationship for 2 years can cause remission

- be careful about making conclusions about your own identity - you will be able to justify anything with the information you have at the time but it is incomplete information - not illogical just incomplete

- you are in therapy to work on something - you are in charge. get what you want out of it

- biggest thing people don't understand is that they are in control of their life with their actions
