### Module 1: Breaking out of the Cookie Cutter Student Mindset
- perspective and ability to learn matters more than rote knowledge
- cookie cutter student issues:
	- same knowledge base as everyone else, no personality/stake in ideas
	- studying takes longer because no personal connection to content
	- learning siloed within semester container, not connected and building
- Zettelkasten - 3 kinds of notes: fleeting notes + literature notes > concept notes 
	- the guy who created this is "disgustingly prolific"
	- the "New Era Student" pyramid - mindset > methods > tools
	- 5 must-have mindsets to make this work:
		- notes are pieces of understanding, not pieces of truth (doesn't allow notes to evolve or include thoughts)
		- create concept notes instead of document notes (too big to link)
		- note taking allows you to clarify your thinking (taking notes is fun because allows you to examine, mix it with journaling)
		- note taking allows you to compound your thinking (build on information, externalizing thoughts)
		- you don't have to take notes on everything - becomes a form of procrastination - only take notes on things that aren't USE (unimportant, self-explanatory, easy to memorize on the spot)
- Conceptual Notemaking - taking notes in own words - add your own unique sauce, using concepts as structure and linking them together, no rigid disciplines - only concepts
- PKM Thinking Styles
	- architect: top-down, creating structure beforehand and filling in with notes (MOC with notes connected to greater concept)
	- gardener: take notes at individual level, link over time/build structure after (notes connected to other individual notes)
- Why Obsidian?
	- customizable like no other app ("essentially just markdown files connected to other markdown files" bruh) 
	- link-based to scale knowledge
	- you own your knowledge - just markdown files on your desktop
	- great community - plugins/youtube
#### Action Items
##### The Cookie Cutter Mindset
what is your mindset towards school now?
- toxic relationship, I love achieving to my best ability and improving my skills but put so much weight into that that it can destroy me at times
in what ways are you a cookie cutter student?
- I want to learn everything the prof covers so do write everything they say/put on slides
do you feel more engaged by other things in life than school? what and why?
- school is very engaging but a balance of personal projects is nice too. right now music is the most exhilarating and engaging thing I am doing. I also like reading/connecting my thoughts and writing and design.
##### How to Break out of the Cookie Cutter Mindset
how much do you reuse and incorporate past learnings into your present semesters?
- quite a bit actually, I feel like I am often referring to things I learn in life and other course while learning it, but of course it fades in time as I learn more
##### Personal PKM Thinking Style
what resonates more to you: gardener or architect?
- definitely an architect ideally, I want there to be some form of structure, otherwise I get overwhelmed and stressed out about the brain space it's taking up.
pkm personality?
- I resonate most with knowledge-worker oriented towards knowledge transmission and focusing on significant, accurate information synthesized from experts. I also resonate with self-guide/coach who is seeking self-knowledge and personal growth.
### Module 2: Obsidian Power User Time
- cmd alt s - shows all open tabs at once
- cmd o - quick switcher
- cmd p - command palette
- cmd shift r - opens same note in another view beside
- link
	- [[note title]]
	- [[note title#header]]
	- [[note title#^block code]] - right click and copy link to block to put in link to link to specific block of text
	- ![[note title ]
	- ! before embeds note in file, can toggle flow to edit content in other file
	- viewing links
		- graph view - notes in vault and connections
		- local graph view - shows notes connected to specific note
	- backlink - links from other notes to current note - see in backlinks pane
	- obsidian strange new worlds plugin - shows all backlinks and outgoing links for note or header

- studying
	- flashcards - expand knowledge to create hooks for new concepts to hang on
	- enumeration: listed in order - better at remembering with order
	- assets: listed without order
	- mnemonic techniques: memory strategies - add pizzazz/feelings/visualize to give more memory cues
		- acronyms
		- the story method - make story around it/experience of it
		- metaphor - compare to something you already understand
		- memory palace - rooms to mean different concepts
	- spaced repetition and active recall
		- each time you learn it it takes longer to forget
		- "Stop associating testing with the paper tests given to you during exams and finals. Testing can is and should be everywhere."
	- growth mindset: intelligence is in your control
		- praise for effort not intelligence to promote growth mindset
		- failure is better than success, success means we are doing the same things we already know in comfort zone, failure is discomfort
	- fixed mindset: predetermined, no freewill
		- **"Whether you think you can or you think you can't, you're right."**
	- the harder it is to learn the harder it is to forget
	- retrospective revision table - includes all topics in course, go through one at a time and rate understanding 1-5, keep going through all until they all have 5
	- cornell note taking system: questions at end to quiz yourself with
	- prioritize gaps
	- massed practice (cramming - forgotten immediately because not sustainable or used consistently) vs. interleaving learning (mixing subjects together to form connections - learning is not as powerful in isolation, application needs all together not piecemeal)
- biases of perception
	- challenge everything with openness - challenge yourself too to not be caught up with biases
	- Dunning Kruger effect - the more you know the less competent you believe you are, greater awareness of the unknown, when you think you know about something you become resistant to learn more about it
- connecting learning to long term memory
	- elaboration - connect new to cemented knowledge, adding memory cues
- do you want to be average at everything or very good at some things? learn what you are passionate about.
- mastery makes you an inconsiderate teacher

### Module 3: Collect, Connect, Create
#### Information Diet
- you are what you consume - information diet impacts thinking and mental health, information you consume should align with values and fuel projects
- mindsets to adopt
	- creator mindset - do something with what you consume, motivates you to consume more, questions to ask when notetaking:
		- who is author and how does that impact what they're going to say?
		- what are the parts/arguments?
		- what is the main argument the parts make up?
		- why does it matter?
	- differentiate information diet - if you consume what everyone else consumes you will think what everyone else thinks
		- choose with intention instead of letting the algorithm decide
		- consuming radically different sources gives you ideas nobody else will have
	- become a lifelong learner - learn intrinsically
	- practice critical thinking, ask questions for everything you consume:
		- who is the author?
		- what stake do they have in the argument?
		- how trustworthy are sources cited?
		- what do others say about information?
		- do arguments lead to the stated conclusion?
		- is there linguistic consistency?
- methods to curate information diet
	- collect toolkit - 3-6 information mediums made easier to consume, add friction to everything else
		- make list of everywhere you consume your information from
		- rate each medium 0-100 on value they provide to life
		- limit yourself to 3-6 mediums - point is to prioritize higher value
		- figure out time spent on each medium per week
		- find mismatch on medium time spent to value provided - do high value ratings match time?
		- course correct - change time spent consuming each medium to reflect value provided
	- reduce friction for consuming in collect toolkit easy, increase friction for not in collect toolkit
		- how can I make this more or less appealing/obvious/easy/reward/punish
	- create your 12 favourite questions, keep them in your mind and test all new information against them to make new connections, allows to differentiate what is important and what isn't
		- determine what you're interested in/are passionate about, make questions based on these?
		- how can I create to connect
		- how can I improve memory
		- how can I understand psychology to enhance connections
		- how can I use Obsidian 
		- how can I write more funny/engaging scripts
		- how can I tell better stories
		- how can I become a more mature human being
		- how can I become a better lover in my romantic relationships
	- start a learning project - consume information with lens of creation, goals shape how you see information, medium to distinguish relevant information  
		- outline learning project - goals/objectives
		- collect information for project - use past information base
		- showcase progress publicly (as you progress) - teach learnings to solidify them and test you understand at all
	- remodelling information diet is most powerful thing you can do to change your life and mindset
	- how you consume information is just as important as what you consume - give yourself time to process, be present
#### Collect
types of notes/status in Obsidian
- input, idea and output
- fleeting note - passing thought throughout day
	- go through and process each day
- input note - notes from information consumed in one place
	- process into concept notes after consumption
- concept notes - focus on one idea, can be large/long, contain your pov/processing too - allow for connection
	- title is statement or question, note elaborates on statement, gives examples, link to other notes
> in the west spiritual practices are made into an ego-strengthening activities (called spiritual materialism), in east were meant to transcend ego
- output notes - written for outside expression
##### Taking Conceptual Notes Step-by-Step
- conceptual note making: take notes in your own words
- take notes on individual concepts at atomic level - link together
- no discrete disciplines (yes)
- creativity training wheels/steroids
- benefits
	- link concepts - your own collection of knowledge
	- deep processing - increase encoding strength by linking to past knowledge
	- joy/curiosity increase, notice connections
- before class: new note and name of class, all lectures/topics that will be covered, lecture and status (red) tag
- in class: open note for lecture, open standard note template, don't write what prof says verbatim, wait 20s-1minute, distill information in argument/question format (for easy quizzing later)
	- up:: link to class taken notes for
	- tags:: status of note (not really necessary)
	- title
	- related - engage in linking to other notes
	- resources - cited in notes
	- QAC (question answer citation) notetaking format for humanities
	- PAS (problem, answer, citation) notetaking format for STEM
	- tag it with chapter/course so you can filter by when studying
- ask yourself the "4 questions of peanut butter godhood" or 4Gs
	- what does this remind me of?
	- what is this similar to?
	- what is this different from?
	- this is important because
- after class: process lecture notes into conceptual notes, change status to green
- after semester: write a summary of course linking all conceptual notes 
#### Connect
- collector's fallacy - hoarding all information, instead connect and do things with your notes - the goal is not notes
- synoptical reading - putting information in conversation with each other - first have to define/align terms to understand different definitions
	- where do authors conflict or agree?
	- how do authors structure their points differently?
	- what is significance of their claims?
- when to grow notes - when you refer to them over and over
- methods to grow notes:
	- freewriting (timed or not, prompts or not) - just write about the topic, use unlinked mentions/strange new worlds plugin to make new connections
	- 4 Gs of notemaking
	- RRR (remark, relate, reference)
		- focus on skills not results to build motivation for things you don't want to do
	- idea compass
	- triangulation/graph view - finding third note linked to two other notes
	- summarize
	- zoom out - generalizing notes to higher order concept (MOCS)
		- generalization by grouping related notes together
		- generalization by emergence - taking notes and creating new idea out of them
- status: update as you add
	- red - not fleshed out
	- yellow - a bit fleshed out
	- green - most fleshed out
- Maps of Content - note that links to other links (dashboard/hub) use links to connect concepts instead of folders (can create multiple connections), can include bulleted list of links to related concepts
- encounter box - collects all notes, MOC with most recent notes created
	- create course MOC - home base for resource (year, semester, prof, uptick to all courses taken over this semester)
	- take conceptual notes for each lecture - status, tags (course), links, summary, notes, related
	- process conceptual notes after class - go through all red tags, tidy it up, summarize main takeaways, create concept notes
	- flesh out course MOC note - map of concept notes summarizing the course, include concept notes from other classes too to connect knowledge
- 5 levels of MOC emergence
	- all mocs start as singular notes, come from fleeting thoughts
	- notes link to other notes - forming connections
	- create moc - want a top-down view of topic - list all the notes related to main concept in bulleted list, move to paragraphs later (look at notes linked, look what is linked to them)
		- dump - all related notes
		- lump - connect/relate notes together, add sentences/paragraphs to connect
		- jump - give it time to simmer, come back and refine periodically
	- link mocs to other mocs
	- create home note moc dashboard with all high order mocs
		- have up link back home/higher level (like breadcrumbs)
		- main sensemaking
		- motivation station
		- inspiration
		- semester rn courses
- different colour from sources, cards, mocs in graph view - shows where parts of knowledge base are coming from
taking book notes:
- read book
- summarize/fill out template
	- book in 3 sentences
	- impressions
	- who should read it
	- how the book changed me
	- top 3 quotes
- consolidate main points into concept notes and link to other atomic notes
- create visual representations of books ideas
#### Create
- the only thing that matters - what it is all for, putting knowledge into action (consumption without application is procrastination)
- repurpose content, combine with new knowledge to make new (intermediate packets)
- 3 step process
	- dump - all ideas for project in document (use backlinks/unlinked mentions to get more resources), title + intro to form argument
	- lump - connecting under themed points (structure/outline points, title)
	- jump - repurposing content from notes into document under points
		- reword/reframe arguments
		- connect together into narrative
		- find holes in argument - areas for further research
- intermediate packets (still kinda unclear on this - is it just notes?) - actionable, compressed parts of past work, start projects 80% done
	- reduce procrastination - make creation more accessible, "what is the most valuable IP that I can create right now?" any amount of time can be used to create value
	- be ready for new opportunities 
	- become gifts to share with other people - list of books with summaries for example
	- just write things down - collect, connect, create
	- brain is for having ideas not storing them

- public learning - more motivation, better understanding when explaining to someone else, share
- ask yourself "2 years ago what did you not know that you know now/wish you had known?"

beginner mistakes of starting Obsidian Zettelkasten
- not connecting notes across semesters - don't fall into comfort level of sequential notes
- not connecting class notes to own learnings (learning has no hierarchy)
- not creating mocs out of course notes

how to make concepts last forever
- let's make this different - create habits/rituals to actually change your life
- time management
	- time blocking - schedule next day before bed, prioritize most important in morning, time block out other things over day (time and place)
	- accountability - make it hurt to not do it
	- systematize - schedule and make systems, make it a part of your life (process notes 15-30 mins a day, schedule parts of project)
	- batching - break parts of notetaking/writing process into batches - minimize context switching (hard for brain)
- energy management
	- exercise
	- sleep - same time each night "you need to respect your body to have quality consciousness"
	- diet - single ingredient foods, 1g protein per pound, fasting
	- objects in motion stay in motion - just do it to start momentum
- habits that stick
	- cue, craving, response, reward loop from Atomic Habits - for all habits good and bad, adjust the parts to modify behaviour
		- cue - make the trigger visible/easy, maybe specific place or object to initiate it
		- craving - to build knowledge/understand new ideas
		- response - the behaviour
		- reward - enjoyment from building knowledge/increasing understanding
### conclusion
- you have finished the course!

## takeaways
- fuck folders links are it
- mocs - for courses/ideas
- kinds of notes (thought, input, concept, output + mocs) - make templates for different types to make it easy
- constant studying/work means less studying and work at once
