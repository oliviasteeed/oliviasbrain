## Summary
### Context
- Webinar from John's friend Aidan Helfant about taking book notes
### Main Takeaways
- Write atomic notes so can make connections between concepts easier, think of [[One idea per sticky note]] philosophy
- Paraphrase and create arguments with notes so they are ready to use
### Questions/Connections/Thoughts
- 
## Notes
#### Guidelines
- **Automaticity**
	- linked notes should have one idea as focal point, other ideas as background/support
	- allows to link easier
- **write in your own words**
	- shows you understand, have own interpretation
	- use quotes to prove it
	- pieces of understanding not pieces of truth - can include questions and thoughts to come back to
- **write book notes as compositions and arguments**
	- title the book note as an argument, expand on proposition or argument
	- makes it easier to link to other books
	- only things that aren't USE - unimportant, self-explanatory, easy to explain on the spot
#### Processing
- **freewriting** - write wth abandon to overcome perfectionism, come back later and refine
- **RRR** 
	- relation - how it is related
	- remark - the content
	- reference - where it came from
- **idea compass** 
	- **north** - upstream (come from)
		- what does idea come from?
		- origin?
		- what belief does idea support?
		- what domain exists an order of magnitude higher? zoom out
		- what gave birth to idea?
		- what causes idea?
	- **west** - reinforcing
		- what is similar to idea?
		- what other disciplines could idea already exist in?
		- what other disciplines could benefit from idea?
		- what are other ways to say/do idea?
	- **south** - downstream (lead to)
		- where can idea lead to?
		- what group/category could idea be headline of?
		- what domain exists an order of magnitude lower? zoom in
		- what does idea nurture?
	- **east** - compete with
		- what competes with idea?
		- what is the opposite of idea?
		- what is idea missing?
		- what is a disadvantage of idea?
		- what could supercharge idea?\

#### Fill out book summary template
- **summary**
	- impressions
- **who should read it?**
- **how the book changed me**
- **linked book notes** - linked to other arguments/propositions from other books
	- making notes for concept takeaways that link between books, the book note itself is just summary template and list of links to concepts
