- listening deeply is understanding what their words mean to them
### Questions/Connections/Thoughts
- 
## Notes
- ask new and genuine questions - don't ask questions you don't want to know the answer to
- don't seek complexity - more systems can be worse than original problem
- classify problems into possibility or probability
- in challenges ask 'what do I have to learn here' 
- what you know is only part of the truth
- learn from every interaction
- good listening - not what their words mean to you but what words mean to them
- learning and work is not separate
