## Notes
- engage body, social relationships and surroundings - don't be brain bound, gather ideas from extra neural sources
- introception - tune inwards to understand body cues, practice body scans
- use objects as thinking aids/extend thinking into physical environment (looking out window for 40s helps productivity - soft fascination instead of deep focus)
- spending time outside is fastest/most powerful way to reset attention
- include other people in thinking processes - collective intelligence
