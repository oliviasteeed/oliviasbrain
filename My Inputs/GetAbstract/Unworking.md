### Main Takeaways
- office as opportunity for mixing
### Questions/Connections/Thoughts
- 
## Notes
- office was first a mechanized factory (belief in hierarchy and process as productivity boosters) then inspired by community (belief in social interaction as productivity boosters)
- knowledge work - the academy, the agora, the guild, the lodge
- new offices attempt to design experiences, wellness at work - give employees control over space
- purpose of office is no longer strict system but collaborative mixing of employees, not reinforcing hierarchies
- constant state of beta - agile organization
- mixed use urban design is the final solution
