## Notes
- in covid remote work was implemented as temporary measure, behaviours not meant to persist over time, more time working on evenings and weekends
- working virtually makes people think you lack commitment, relationships deteriorate, communication suffers, project completion time longer, less promotions
- shifting to remote work leads to outsourcing to cheapest locations
- redesign and rethink office work norms
- less informal development opportunities - kneecapping yourself
- hard to translate company culture to remote workers, do not do online onboarding
