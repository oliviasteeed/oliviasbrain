## Notes
- self-determination theory of motivation: things that tap into deepest goals motivate best
	- diagnosis: understand target users challenges
	- prescription: solution concept
	- execution: make it
	- evaluation: measure effectiveness
- define success - journey map, storyboard, article
- outcome logic map plotting what you'll measure to quantify success
- won't stick with it if they feel forced, must connect themself to value they have already
- give sense of control and autonomy - choices, opt out, customization
- question laddering: keep asking why new features are necessary until they cannot answer any more
- COM-B Model of Behaviour Change: must have capability, opportunity, motivation required to achieve desired behaviours
- things limiting behaviour change: reduce these to reduce onboarding slope

- you can encourage a growth mindset with positive encouragement, give challenge and reward - flow, tie feedback to next action step
- encourage connections with support systems/expanding it out - boosts likelihood of achieving goals
- design an experience that helps people feel understood or seen - allow customization and anthropomorphization
- establishing trust - connect to research, outcomes - they need to trust it to follow it longterm/believe in it, don't let them have doubts
- target users' future selves - making commitments to future self, help people realistically conceptualize future selves, aid in goal-setting (short term at first to have wins)
