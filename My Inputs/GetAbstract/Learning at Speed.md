## Summary
### Context
- book about how to maximize benefits of research to develop effective learning and development content
### Main Takeaways
- understand what skill gap/learning issue you are trying to solve - what do they need in that moment? what are they trying to 
- clearly outline learning project objectives
### Questions/Connections/Thoughts
- 
## Notes
- in world of exponential change, those who learn the fastest succeed
- LND (Learning and Development) - develop learning content incrementally and change based on feedback
	- don't need to be refined full course, give constantly improving/updating pieces of learning
- chunking learning into relevant areas 
- action orientation - action over perfectionism
- design learning to close specific skill gaps - make sure there is a need for it
- develop learning strategy - think of jobs to be done/end goal and connect learning to this
- talk to end users!!
	- what is problem? why it matters?
	- success? who will solution help?
	- what have they tried before?
	- what do they think will work? why? 
	- what is being done now?
- create one-page summary of learning challenge, break into components (first principles approach) - one page statement Learning Canvas:
	- summary of problems
	- list of people who will use solution/description (jobs, dept, location)
	- benefits of solutions to people by group
	- description of solution 
	- list of critical learning resources you'll build/use
	- list of key partners and stakeholders with whom to collaborate
	- metrics used to track progress
	- ultimate measurable outcomes you hope to achieve
	- budget and timeframe
- deliver context-dependent help - people want help when they need it
- may need to help people collaborate/find each other to share knowledge and information. maybe need central location of resources, not more resources
- adopt lean approach - MVP and sprints
- minimum valuable learning - delivers all outcomes, helps you gain feedback and create full solution
	- break task into chunks, do 2-4 week sprints for each chunk
	- someone to manage sprints
		- map idea, plan sprint, build/plan MVL, testing with users, synthesizing feedback into insights to improve product
	- link learning outcomes to KPIs
