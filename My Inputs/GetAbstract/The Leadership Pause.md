## Notes
- life is not meant to be frantic - dispiriting, burnout - take a pause, take many pauses
- pauses help you understand purpose
- mindset: basic frame of reference, window on the world, want your mindset to be an asset not a burden - open/growth: new situations with curiosity and minimal fear, closed/rigid: inflexible
- thread connecting you to important aspects of your life - reflect to identify and get in touch with purpose - avoiding actions deflecting you from purpose
- daily practices are who you are, healthy habits don't always come naturally, so be intentional about them
- life unfolds in series of habits, positive habits to reduce cognitive burden of maintaining healthy lifestyle - hardwired into new neural pathways - "body-based intelligence", eliminate need for willpower
- don't expect this process to go smoothly - stumble forwards
- **questions to ask yourself to reflect on purpose:**
	- do you provide yourself with sufficient space to expand thinking and grow mentally
	- do you go out of your way to relate positively to those around you?
	- do you regularly monitor energy levels?
	- do you always make an effort to be respectful to others, particularly in conversation?
	- do you feel exhausted at day end - how can you change this?
	- how often do you include a long walk?
	- how will you know when you're at risk for burnout?
	- do you routinely give yourself permission to operate at reduced capacity?
	- how often do you take a day off to decompress, reorient, regroup?
	- do you get enough sleep? build your schedule so you always do
	- do you exercise regularly?
	- how often do you take in the natural world? really exist
	- do you regularly ask yourself 'what's possible' instead of 'what's practical'?
	- when do you feel most alive? do you go out of your way to feel energized as much as possible?
	- what can you do to change your daily routine so you feel fulfilled more often?
