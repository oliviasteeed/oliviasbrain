## Notes
- move from letting culture happen to deliberately designing it
- move from perceived business-based value to achievement-based value
- civilization begins when people help each other in times of difficulty
- clarity of purpose - not just about goals or objectives, not mission statement (inflating it), purpose statement (how it helps others) - moving in same direction as employees, determined by actions not words
- state each team's purpose and goals (one-line sentence with what your team contributes or produces) - more productive and fulfilling, stronger connections, understanding how you are contributing to company
- to succeed as company respect employee need to feel connection
- design, not luck, produces effective collaboration - produce better ideas alone
