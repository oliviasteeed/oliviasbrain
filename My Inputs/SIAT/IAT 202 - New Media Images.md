Reading Week 2: 

  

Film Directing Shot-By-Shot:

Chapter 6: Composing Shots:

Basic Blocks: long shot, medium shot, close up

-narrative logic between shots creates continuous space

-cause and effect + spatial recognition = continuity

1. Close Up: face/part of body
    

-popularized by TV (small screen), cheapest to film/light

-level of invasion/intimacy

-use off-center framing and dynamic cuts

2. Medium Shot: body gestures and facial expression
    

-used for dialogue with close up

3. Full Shot: establishing shot
    

-not used for dialogue because requires it to be one take

-allows body language

  

Line of Action: organize camera angles to preserve consistent screen direction/space (to avoid excessive relighting)

Triangle System: 3 basic shots can be taken within 180º of working space, can be joined together

1. angular singles (MS or CU)
    
2. master 2 shots
    
3. over the shoulder shots
    
4. POV singles (MS or CU)
    
5. profile
    

  

Establishing a New Line:

1. person turns attention to other person, creating new line
    
2. have person cross own line of action, overrides with a new one
    
3. uninterrupted camera move over old line of action
    
4. cutaway/bridge shot not in geography of scene
    

  

Line of Action for Moving Subjects/Action: more dynamic if break rules

Action Sequence: no line of sight to establish line of action, follows dominant motion of shot subject (implied sight line)

Crossing the Line in Action Sequence:

1. subject crosses line and establishes new one with direction of motion
    
2. camera crosses line following subject/new space
    
3. new subject enters, creates new
    

Crossing Line While on Line: the closer camera is to line the harder it is to tell when crossed

  

Chapter 7: Editing: Temporal Connections

Composition: structure/shots

Editing: order

  

Narrative Impulse:

Plot: events with causal connection

-setting up expectations, satisfying or breaking them

-2 shots (what is connection?), 3rd shot to link them

  

Q&A Patterns:

-can be two shots (looking off, what looking at)

-depends on context of setup

Using the Pattern:

-place audience in privileged place with more info

-answer question (or give answer) several shots earlier/later

Limits of Clarity:

-can use establishing shot or multiple Q&A shots to establish setting

  

Camera Cutting: go exactly with plan

Coverage: shoot with different stock camera angles, edit later, backup shots in case

  

Composing Action for Editing:

1. cutting on movement (hides cut)
    
2. exists/entrances (cut when still partially in frame)
    
3. clearing frame (hold for moment, then cut, good for transitions of same subject different background or to show time passage)
    

  

Camera Angles Meaning:

1. straight (equality, most common)
    
2. high (looking down on/with the subject)
    
3. low (significance/power of subject)
    
4. tilted (unbalanced/instability)
    

  

Lecture Week 2:

Cinematography: selecting shots, camera angles, compositions to tell stories

-always consider the audience (what do I want them to know/feel?)

Shot: single take

Scene: several shots

Sequence: several scenes

1. Deductive Sequence: wide > medium > close
    

-old-fashioned, suited to big screen

-more information in bigger scenes so held longer

2. Inductive Sequence: close > wide (or no resolution)
    

-only pieces, use psychological closure to explain story

Overall Approach:

1. documentary style (objective, serious, boring)
    
2. looking into style (capture subjective feelings with camera shots)
    
3. creating style (use of effects)
    

Camera Angle: audience viewpoint and area conveyed in shot

-check all 4 corners to see there’s nothing weird

-can be subtle

  

Lecture Week 3: Intro to Editing:

  

Aperture: depth of field

ISO: sensitivity to light, lower than 800 for no grain

Shutter Speed: amount of time sensor exposed (180 rule: double frame rate)

  

We shoot: 1920 x 1080 x 24fps

  

Film Grammar: how we understand/communicate in film

Sequence: forms narrative unit through beats

Scene: made of minor beats

1. framing (CU, MS)
    
2. shot length (in seconds)
    
3. logic of cutting (on action, transitions)
    
4. camera movements (pan, handheld, tracking)
    
5. ellipsis (don’t show everything)
    

Editing: coordination of shots to evoke a reaction

Classical Cutting: cut to emphasize shot

  

DW Griffith: 1908-1915

-created foundation of continuity editing/film language

-made a birth of a nation (racist do not watch)

-over 1000 edits (most has less than 100)

-coverage (shoot scene from many angles)

-close up to emphasize drama

  

Continuity Editing: started with DW Griffith

-continuous feeling of space and time (invisible editing)

-scenes from many angles (coverage, at least 3 times)

-editor strings these into continuous piece

  

Montage Editing: started with Kuleshov (who studies Griffith)

-shot collision, 2 unrelated shots create new meaning

-juxtaposition of shots for emotion

-edited strongly for rhythmic qualities of a scene

Kuleshov Effect: what you put together changes preceding shot meaning

-sum of shots > individual shots

  

Soviet Montage Theory:

1. Rhythmic: most common, created rhythmic feeling, cut on action (similar to continuity editing)
    

-has idea to convey, not about establishing

2. Hollywood Montage:
    

1. speed up time
    
2. make em laugh
    
3. develop characters
    
4. build a gestalt
    
5. create meaning with juxtaposition
    
6. combine storylines
    

  

Lecture Week 4: Intro to Soundtrack Design

  

Walter Murch: created Worldizing: playing audio in space being played in movie, blending with original recording to create more believable sound

  

1. Diegetic Sound: in the story world (the characters hear it)
    

-recorded at time of shooting or in post

-music, dialogue

1. source connected: see it on screen
    
2. source disconnected: do not see it on screen
    

2. Non-Diegetic Sound: not in the story world (characters don’t hear it) 
    

-always recorded in post

3. Trans-Diegetic Sound: goes from one type to the other (bridge or link)
    

Sound Bridge: sound of next shot plays while preceding shot is still on screen

L: cutting forward

J: cutting backward

  

Editing: coordination of one shot with next, provide variety, consider viewer reaction

NOT style/techniques (wtf are they then?):

1. Continuity Editing: shots creating continuous space and time
    

-meant to be invisible

-establishing shot, shot-reverse shot, master shot, eyeline match (coverage)  
Cutting on Action: action started in one shot, finished in another

Match on Action: match position/trajectories in each shot

30º Rule: change angle between cut on action shots ~30º

2. Montage Editing (complexity editing): separate shots edited together, juxtapositions creating meaning
    

-allow you to speed up time

-meant to be visible

  

Lecture Week 5: Lighting

  

Lighting: direct manipulation of light/shadows for a specific communication purpose

-clarifies/intensifies events

-light bypasses usual cognitive perceptual screens (rational/critical/judgment)

Cinematic Light: beyond 3pt for drama and atmosphere

5 Reasons to Light:

1. get exposure right
    
2. show shapes
    
3. depth
    
4. emotion/mood
    
5. effect/illusion of different time and place
    

  

Shadows:

1. Attached: fixed to an object, defining shape
    
2. Cast: comes from an object but exists off of it
    

1. Disconnected: separation between object and shadow
    
2. Connected: shadow comes directly off object
    
3. Independent: do not see object casting shadow
    

Falloff: used to describe gradations of light to dark

1. Fast: fast gradation, light turns to dark quickly
    
2. Slow: slow gradation, light slowly turns to dark
    
3. Elimination: completely lit (romantic comedy/artificial)
    

  

3 Point Lighting: the standard

1. Key: the main source of light
    

-higher = deep shadows

-low for reverse shadows (sinister)

-behind = silhouette

-right beside camera = glamour lighting

2. Fill: fills in shadows
    

-doesn’t create second shadow

3. Backlight: separates character from background
    

  

Practical Light: within scene

Natural Light: from the sun

(blue hour = little bit before sun up/down)

(magic hour = right as sun on horizon)

  

Complexity Editing:

1. Jump Cut: single shot broken with cut to jump instantly in time
    
2. Smash Cut: use cut to highlight dramatic contrast between 2 scenes
    

-action towards camera 

  

Lecture Week 6: Lighting and Story

  

Lighting Styles:

1. Chiaroscuro: fast falloff in attached shadows
    

Low Key effect in background (almost dark but clear separation)

-articulates space, intensifies 3D

-expressive quality, light comes from within scene

-organic (looks natural, using principal lights)

-directional

-spatial compositional (light as part of composition)

-thematic (to support story), emotional

2. Rembrandt
    

  

Narrative: chain of events linked by cause and effect occurring in time and space

Story: events as they occur in chronological order (all background the writer knows)

Plot: strategy filmmaker uses to present story to audience (what the audience sees)

  

Story = character transformation!

Weakness, struggle, change

1. protagonist has weakness
    
2. catalyst starts action
    
3. protagonist creates conflict, meaningful struggle
    
4. protagonist changed for better/worse
    
5. stakes if does/doesn’t occur
    

  

Protagonist: drives action

Antagonist: force working against the protagonist, opposite (not always a person)

Catalyst: triggers the action, starts story, has stakes

Stakes: why do we care? have to be risk to fail

  

Lecture Week 7: Screen Direction

  

Editing: coordination of one shot with the next 

1. Continuity Editing: creating mental map for viewers, invisible
    

1. Establishing Shot: establishes context of axis of action
    
2. Shot Reverse Shot: after axis of action established
    
3. Eyeline Match: show eye and thing looking at
    
4. Match on Action: action started in one, finished in other (30º rule)
    

3. Montage (Complexity Editing): different shots edited together
    

  

Screen Direction: Continuity Vectors:

-things in motion pull the eye most

-motion avoids “flatness,” 3D world through lighting and character positioning

-cutting on continuing vectors = smoother shots

  

Motion Vectors: created by object moving or seen as moving on screen

-creating mental map for viewers

1. Continuous Vector: going same direction (smooth)
    
2. Converging Vector: going different directions (opposition/conflict)
    

  

Screen direction and real life direction is not the same!

180º Rule: maintain character vectors and shoot in 180º arc on one side

-using establishing, subjective, OTS, CU shots within 

-reestablish by moving camera over the line

Cut In: after other footage

Cut Away: show other footage before reestablishing

Angles = more interesting shots
