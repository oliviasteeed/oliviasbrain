Lecture Week 1: What is Psychology

  

Levels of Psych Analysis:

1. Brain (biology)
    
2. Person (mind)
    
3. Group (social influence)
    

  

Wilhelm Wundt: father of experimental psychology

-trying to make study of human behaviour into a science with empirically-driven experiments

-studied consciousness using hard science attitude, breaking down into basic structure

-developed psychological paradigm of voluntarism:¬†

1. a person‚Äôs will organizes consciousness into higher order thoughts
    
2. not paying attention = no consciousness = no thoughts
    
3. attention has a structure, we organize to understand
    
4. willfully make decisions based on what makes sense
    

Issues: all research used self-report (subjective/unreliable), can‚Äôt actually observe it

  

Structuralism: components of consciousness

Edward Titchener: developed structuralism in attempt to identify all elements of consciousness with introspection: observing one‚Äôs own mental processes

Goal: only to describe observable mental processes (not to explain, predict, control), discover laws governing consciousness

Issues: subjectivity, reflection can change opinions/experience, no goal

  

Functionalism: flow of consciousness

William James: opened first psychology lab in US at Harvard, wrote first psychology textbook (Principles of Psychology in 1890)

-discovering what is function/goal of consciousness (influenced by Darwin, environmental adaptation)

-using empirical methods (repeatable experiment recipe) to find cause/consequence of behaviour, studying animals, children, people with mental disorders¬†

-how people perceive things (subjectivity okay when asking what function), perception depends on expertise/experience

-to adapt we must come to agreement/compromise

-consciousness as flowing stream instead of fixed elements (only conscious of some elements in stream)

  

Gestalt Psychology: innate tendency to see whole perceptual units

-opposite of Wundt, consciousness cannot be broken down, only has meaning together

-whole > sum of parts

-learning tied to perception

  

Psychoanalysis: psychology of unconscious¬†

Sigmund Freud: behaviours based on unconscious drives and conflicts

-developed psychoanalysis: aimed to resolve unconscious conflicts (anxiety/conflict when suppress issues)

-personality theorist, personality made of parts (id, ego, superego)

-childhood experience impact

  

Behaviourism: study of controllable, observable behaviour, fed up of consciousness

Edward Thorndike: research on animals can explain human behaviour

-can in box, repeats behaviour to escape and get food

Ivan Pavlov: classical conditioning: dogs associate bell with food, salivate at bell

Watson: ‚Äúlittle Albert,‚Äù child can be classically conditioned to be afraid of mouse/any fuzzy thing (associate with loud sound)

B. F. Skinner: operant conditioning: using immediate reinforcement to change frequency of behaviours

1. positive reinforcement: increases behaviour
    
2. negative reinforcement: decrease behaviour
    

Punishment:

1. negative: take something away
    
2. positive: add something (slap)
    

Bandura: learning by social observation in children/primates, model behaviour of others

-bobo doll experiment (more kids beat up bobo doll after saw adults beating it up)

-moral panic around when TV started (showing violence)

  

Humanism: a new direction

Carl Rogers: client-centered therapy: client is equal (unlike the dominant Freud), therapist mirrors thoughts and feelings, unconditional support and positive regard

-listen and lead to self-made solution

-problems from not having unconditional love from parents (inferred or direct), giving acceptance people need

  

Positive Psychology: focus on human strengths, fulfillment, creativity

-start from positives and aim for more of that

-build up positives, downplay negatives

  

Cognitive Psychology: mind as information processing (beginning of computers)

Hebb: Canadian, developed concept of cell assembly

-learning involves making new neuron connections, gets easier as you practice because connections get stronger, neurons fire in response to activity)

-led to discovery of reward system

Chapter 1: Psychology Yesterday and Today

  

A. What is Psychology?

LO: define/describe goals and levels of analysis psychologists use

  

Psychology: science of studying mental processes and behaviour

Mental Processes: brain activity when thinking, processing information, using language

-in early history observed through external behaviours, not that psychology is empirical science it uses brain imaging

Behaviour: observable actions of organism in response to environment

  

Goals of Studying Mental Processes/Behaviour:

1. Description: specifically describe observations
    
2. Explanation: develop theories explaining observations
    
3. Prediction: predict behaviours in a given context
    
4. Control: limit or increase certain behaviours
    

  

Levels of Behaviour: always interacting

1. Brain: neuronal activity during information processing, structure/formation of brain, individual differences
    
2. Person: how content of mental processes (emotions/thought/ideas) influence behaviour, consciousness, personality, motivation, intelligence
    
3. Group: how peoples‚Äô behaviour is shaped by social environment changing over time, groups share culture
    

Culture: group sharing intergenerational set of beliefs, values, practices, history¬†

  

B. Psychology's Roots in Philosophy:

LO: describe influence of myths, rituals and greek philosophies on psychology

  

Myths: stories of forgotten origin attempting to explain universal mysteries of life

Rituals: social/customary rituals relating to myths that celebrate religious or social occasions

-innate human need to understand others and the natural world

  

Greek Philosophers: start of psychology due to written language

Philosophy: study of knowledge, reality and nature and meaning of life

-moved beyond myths, engaged in debate

-emphasized that theories are never final

-recognized physical and mental health are integrated

  

1. Hippocrates: thought health determined by four bodily humours (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, black bile), out of balance causes illness
    

-first to recognize importance of good food, fresh air, rest

-identified brain as organ of mental life where feelings/thoughts originate (as opposed to heart)

-tested theories with experimentation and observation

2. Plato: human mind innately imprinted with all relevant knowledge
    

-healthy mind = balance of intellect, emotion, base desires and appetites

3. Aristotle: student of Plato
    

-first theories of sensations, dreams, sleep, learning

-first to promote empirical observations of natural world

-Europeans rediscover Greek philosophy 2000 years later after Dark Ages, mysticism declines but still lack consensus

4. Ren√© Decartes: first modern philosopher, meaning of natural world can be discovered through science and math
    

-mind and body are distinct but connected at pineal gland, mind lived on after death

-after Renaissance mysticism replaced with mathematics and science fixed by natural laws

5. Francis Bacon: created Empiricism: all knowledge originates from experience
    

-popularized scientific method, gathering/analyzing data, performing experiments

6. John Locke: learn from experiences, mind at birth is blank slate
    
7. Johannes M√ºller: Psychophysics: study relationship between stimuli and psychological effects
    
8. Hermon Von Helmholtz: determined nerve impulses occur over time, not instantaneously, meaning thought and nerve movement are linked but not the same
    
9. Gustav Fechner: on of founders of experimental psychology, created methods and study techniques
    

-evidence of physical and mental event relationship meant psychology could be a qualified science

10. Willhelm Windt: working with Helmholtz created psychology as discipline
    

  

C. The Early Days of Psychology:

LO: name important early psychologists and describe major theories and research methods

  

Charles Darwin: evolution from natural selection where some variations are adaptive, all animals related

The Founding of Psychology:

Wundt: opened lab dedicated to psychology study using experimental methods, differentiating it from philosophy

-simple, repeatable experiments to observe and gather data from

-studies content and process of consciousness, wanted to break into basic elements

Consciousness: awareness of immediate behaviours and mental processes

-interested in will, developed voluntarism

Voluntarism: voluntary/willful acts of decision in human behaviour, idea that attention and behaviour serves a purpose¬†

-earliest recognition of social context impact on mental processes and behaviour

  

1. Structuralism: components of consciousness
    

Titchener: forms structuralism based on Wundt‚Äôs approach

-consciousness as individual elements

Goal: breaking experiences/mental processes down into smallest pieces (sensations/feelings), find laws governing interactions

Research Method: Introspection: ‚Äúlooking inwards,‚Äù careful observation of mental processes/how thoughts expand into complex ideas

Issues: unreliable, reflection changes experience, no goal (gathering knowledge for its own sake)

  

2. Functionalism: practical application
    

James: shifting attention from structure to purpose of consciousness

-consciousness as stream of events

Goal: discovering adaptive purpose of human thoughts, perceptions, emotions (inspired by Darwin)

Research Method: empirical methods, examining individual differences (children, animals, disabled people)

Impact: led psychology to approach socially relevant topics

  

3. Gestault Psychology: innate tendency to see things as ‚Äúwhole‚Äù perceptual units rather than individual sensations
    

Goal: find why subjective experience differs from objective reality

Research Method: studied illusions/errors in perception, memory, judgement

-learning tied to perception

Problem Solving: sudden, complete insight into solution

  

D. Twentieth-Century Approaches:

LO: summarize major principles of psychoanalytical, behaviourist, humanistic, cognitive, neuroscience approaches to psychology

  

1. Psychoanalysis: psychology of unconscious
    

Unconscious: thoughts/feelings/sensations outside awareness that impact behaviour

Sigmund Freud: many feelings in unconscious, have enormous impact on behaviour

-interested in Hysteria: most often women suffering loss of perceptual/cognitive/motor function without known cause

-believed mental issues are caused by childhood trauma

Psychoanalytic Theory: cause of maladies are mental, unconscious emotions trying to enter awareness

-childhood experiences/milestones crucial to development and functioning

-personality shaped by tension between primal urges and societal norms/expectations

  

2. Behaviourism: psychology of adaptation
    

-study only directly observable behaviours and relations of stimuli and responses

Stimuli: environmental events triggering change in internal/external states

Response: reaction to stimuli

Ivan Pavlov: discovered Conditioning: associating one stimuli with another so they elicit the same response

Edward Thorndike: animal studies can tell us about human behaviour

John Watson: pioneered behaviourism

-launched modern psychological theory with child conditioning

BF Skinner: expanded behaviourism to include internal states, observe behaviour first then theorize internal causes

-consequences change behaviour

Positive Reinforcement: positive outcome = repeat behaviour

Negative Reinforcement: no longer negative outcome (netural), less compelling

Punishment: negative outcome = decrease behaviour

  

3. Humanism: prominence to special features of human functioning
    

Carl Rogers & Abraham Maslow: reject behaviourist reductive view, consider human potential, subjectivity, consciousness, freewill

Maslow: humans have basic need to fulfill potential: Self Actualization

Rogers: Client-Centered Therapy: client as equal, mirror clients‚Äô thoughts/feelings in environment of unconditional positive regard

  

4. Cognitive Psychology: revitalizing study of the mind
    

-applying empirical methods to human thought

-study of Information Processing: how information is stored and operates internally

Cognition: mental processes of knowing, perceiving, remembering

-compare human mind to computer

Cultural Psychology: how cultural practices shape psychology and behaviour

Cross-Cultural Psychology: study of universal human behaviour

  

5. Psychobiology/Neuroscience: exploring origins of mind
    

Neuroscience: explaining psychological functions with biological foundation

Karl Lashley: destroyed parts of animal brains, observed outcome, found that parts of brain are linked to specific behaviours

James Olds: discovered animal ‚Äúreward centre,‚Äù do task to be stimulated there

Roger Sperry: pioneered split brain research, severed halves and observed functioning (can function independently)

Behavioural Genetics: influence of genes on cognition and behaviour

Sociobiologists: humans have innate understanding of how social behaviour should be organized, predisposed to language, culture, territory, rules, regulations (biological and cultural influences)

Epigenetics: environment changes gene expression and behaviour

Evolutionary Psychology: body/brain = products of evolution, genetic inheritance shapes thoughts and behaviours

-goal to identify Cultural Universality: practices/behaviours present in all cultures

  

6. Positive Psychology: human strengths, fulfillment, creativity
    

-too much focus on weakness and pathology, focus instead on what makes life worth living (happiness, meaning, character strengths)

-positive aspects impact development, behaviour, boost immune system

Positive Psychotherapy: does not treat specific issue but increases positive emotions/meaning/engagement

  

Lecture 2: Introduction to Research

  

Psychology: using the scientific method to study human behaviour and mental processes

Pseudo-psychology: commenting on human behaviour/mental processes without using scientific method (crystal healing, hypnosis)

Scientific Method: how we discover laws governing the universe

1. Deductive Reasoning: I know it already
    

-use laws to make prediction, then do experiment (already assuming result)

-susceptible to bias (seeing what you want to see)

2. Inductive Reasoning: shot in the dark
    

-start with observations, then make predictions/theories based on them

-avoiding bias by starting with observations

3. Hypothetico-Deductive Reasoning: I have a testable idea
    

-start with hypothesis (informed prediction) then observe to prove or deny hypothesis and build theory

  

Steps in Scientific Investigation:

1. testable question
    
2. develop testable hypothesis (trying to show hypothesis is ‚Äúnot wrong‚Äù rather than prove right)
    
3. design test (research method), define variables
    
4. analyze data, reject or accept hypothesis
    
5. seek review, publish or replicate
    
6. build or add to theory
    

  

Research Methods:

1. Descriptive Research: observation to find correlations of variables
    

Descriptive Statistics: describe the data, link variables (correlation)

1. Case Study: 1-2 people in depth, can‚Äôt generalize
    
2. Naturalistic Observation: observe in natural state, often children (hard to experiment on/get to cooperate)
    
3. Survey: ask questions, lots of data but hard to do things with it, people lie/don‚Äôt understand questions/get bored, scale problems
    

2. Experimental Research: manipulating variables to establish cause and effect
    

Inferential Statistics: draw conclusions about data, are groups different and is difference¬†

-control over variables

-behaviour may be artificially changed because of lab/experiment, expensive, researcher bias

  

Statistics: describe/measure/interpret relationship between two variables

-provides snapshot of data (mean, median, mode)

Terminology:

Operational Definition: what each variable means/how it will be measured

Participants/Subjects: whose behaviour is systematically observed

Data Collection Techniques: allows for empirical observation/measurement

  

Measures of Central Tendency: typical/average score in a distribution

Mean: average, sensitive to extremes

Median: score in center (if even number add middle numbers and divide by 2)

Mode: most common score

  

Measures of Variability: how much scores differ from each other

Standard Deviation: numeric depiction of how much scores vary from each other

-high variability in data = high standard deviation number

-low variability in data = low standard deviation number

  
![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/SmZ2x8tX5D5p57VRFVXVjdNddqFqrBTLhDZAYNMX456EvtNuSQw77Mq0RARF7VyiMTbrkA5dnntugO_wxH1j0gbdmpAoiMp6sAZuI2r38qvkSrXVqeoje2W6hXeQMGvoew6uVhekjbQ9frIWPya4G5U)

Measures of Correlation: when two variables are related

Correlation Coefficient: numerical index of strength and direction of variable relationship

0 to 1, positive or negative

-closer to 1 means stronger relationship

Positive Correlation: both go up

Negative Correlation: when one goes up, other goes down

-even if Perfect Correlation (1), can‚Äôt determine causation (third variable problem, direction of causation)

  
  
  

Experiments: manipulation of IV under controlled conditions to measure resulting DV change (establish cause and effect)

-control extraneous variables that could mess with results

Population: all people who could have tested variable

Representative Sample: same demographics as population so can generalize results

Random Assignment: everyone in representative sample has equal chance of being in control or experimental group, balanced in any factor that could influence results

Demand Characteristics: researcher unintentionally conveying expected/wanted outcome to participants

Double-Blind: researcher and participants both do not know what group is which or what hypothesis is

Experimental Group: exposed to IV

Control Group: not exposed to IV (used to compare how IV changes DV)

  
  

Problems:

1. Sampling Bias: not representative population
    
2. Placebo Effects: mental effects from thinking one is getting treatment
    
3. Distortions in Self-Reported Data: social desirability bias (fit in with socially approved answers), response set (respond to questions in particular way), halo effect (initial impression effects judgements)
    
4. Experimenter Bias (errors in favour of hypothesis, expectations/preferences in outcomes influencing results (demand characteristics), use double-blind solution)
    

  

Advantages: establish cause and effect, isolate variables, eliminate outside influences

Disadvantages: may not be generalizable, sometimes unethical, artificial nature of experiments

Field Experiment: studies using settings that are very much like real life

  

Variations:¬†

1. expose single group to 2 conditions (less extraneous variables)
    
2. manipulate more than one IV (variable interaction)
    
3. use more than one DV (more complete picture of IV effects)
    

  

Experimental Analysis: compare mean/SD in each group

T-Test: 2 groups

Analyses of Variance: 2+ groups

Statistically Significant: less than 5%/0.05 chance due chance

P-Value/Probability Statistic: <0.05 / 5% due to chance = statistically significant

  

Ethical Research Guidelines:

1. informed consent
    
2. protect from harm
    
3. confidentiality
    
4. voluntary participation
    
5. worthy deception/incomplete disclosure
    
6. adequate debriefing¬†
    

  

Conclusion:

Replication: repeated testing of hypothesis to ensure results from experiment are not due to chance

-allows theories/laws to be developed, contribute to knowledge

-share findings in journal article

  

Parts of a Journal Article:

1. Abstract: summary
    
2. Literature Review: synopsis of other people‚Äôs research in the field to give context/background for study
    
3. Hypothesis: prediction, at end of literature review, back up hypothesis with previous literature
    
4. Method: recipe for the study (so peers can see if makes sense or replicate it)
    
5. Results: statistics, is it significant?
    
6. Discussion: what does it mean? no numbers explanation of what was found and implications/real-world application
    
7. References: list of everyone cited in paper
    

  

Chapter 2 Reading: Psychology as a Science

  

A. What is a Science?

LO: 2 core beliefs of science, scientific method steps

  

Scientific Principles:

1. Universe operates according to laws of nature
    
2. Laws are discoverable through testing
    

Scientific Method:

1. observation
    
2. hypothesis
    
3. testing
    
4. theory
    

Deductive Reasoning: apply broad principle to specific situation, susceptible to biases

Bias: distorted beliefs based on subjective view of reality

Inductive Reasoning: use specific situation to create broad principle

Empirical: objectively testable

Theories: ideas about laws

Hypothetico-Deductive Reasoning: process of modern science, make educated guess and test with experiment to support or invalidate

Hypothesis: objectively falsifiable statement about variable relation![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/BBnsw2MumR5LsVioGzVZw1leb0HC7f-1oDP9J2qLQ_hxvCQlsGNbO7OswQJxJOAvBFL5PUyOBhyAgvVhYRdo2VyZvT1p8ZLCLQDT0_Lfz8DRVk-ND-f6va-UkxhKW7I7-ckoZm9mLx47c-IdZWfuBAQ)

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

B. Psychology as Science

-natural science focusing on subjective subjects (values, personality, morality)

-different research method depending on area of psychology

Goals: isolate factors contributing to human behaviour

Pseudopsychology/Pop Psychology: appears scientific but lacking scientific method, promise to solve any and all problems

  

C. Conducting Research

LO: steps in research process, characteristics of descriptive and experimental methods

1. hypothesis: one variable impacts another variable in this way![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/npG-3f4Lcr2pa-mCB9yE-NQ3s3p-BWzbiFM8HyBblRtFAxcBSAebHTHs0t__eDxVgO3WEkKhYunK5jY4OBC9xN6GIp-6Wh_nWCJK71phQqg6UKCl7ACVSlVVLZQEF17eBzBN8lR5A8jdTvauPizakaE)
    

Variable: condition/event studies

Independent Variable: active condition controlled by researchers

Dependent Variable: passive condition observed by researchers

Operationalize: define variables to make them testable

  

2. participants:
    

Sample: group standing for population

Random Selection: choosing participants so everyone of interest has equal chance to be involved (avoid sampling bias)

  

3. research method:
    

1. Descriptive: determine existence/strength of variable correlation
    

1. Case Study: focus on single person
    

-good for developing early ideas

-can have researcher bias: see what expect to see, cannot be

generalized

2. Naturalistic Observation: directly observing normal behaviour
    

-more reflective of actual behaviour

-researcher bias (have more than one, unaware of hypothesis),

presence of observer can change behaviour

Hawthorne Effect: change of behaviour due to being watched, not

experimental participation

3. Survey: questionnaire/interview
    

-gives information hard to observe, can measure strength of variable

relationship

-unreliable (participant bias), different interpretation, cannot tell

direction of relation

Online:¬†

pro: reach more people, cleaner data, immediate feedback

con: honesty concerns, not diverse samples

2. Experimental: establish cause and effect, manipulate independent variable, observe dependent variable
    

Experimental Group: exposed to IV

Control Group: not exposed to DV

-can be complex to account for interaction effects

Random Assignment: everyone has equal chance of being in control/experimental group

Demand Characteristics: unintentionally conveying desired outcome

Double-Blind: participant and researcher don‚Äôt know which group is which![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/x4MoI57mKZwLaiWN0VY82RGMddiRhLscoH7DMv6gdxfBhCkZz23jDJ2N0JUWTPyCjRftApwuDSPpzbKKFNHur1MLInJHCzxi75MhEYvqVtDSfaa5qeKHWQI2qWd1CiPsRfZrPZVVbeGr8s9rSICDCWI)

D. Understanding Results

LO: information conveyed by statistics, correlation coefficient, mean, standard deviation

  

Statistics: describe/measure variable relations

1. Correlation: predictable relationship between 2+ variables
    

Correlation Coefficient: statistics expressing strength/nature of variable relationship, -1.00 to +1.00

Positive Correlation: numbers both increase

Negative Correlation: high one, low other

-larger number = stronger

Perfect Correlation: variables always exactly related

-0.3 and above = matters in psychology

-does not tell us causality!

2. Cause and Effect
    

-causality requires Experimental Analyses:

1. Descriptive Statistics: describe and summarize data
    
2. Inferential Statistics: infer something broad from results
    

Mean: arithmetic average

Standard Deviation: how much people‚Äôs scores vary within a group

T-tests: 2 groups

Analyses of Variance: 2+ groups

Statistically Significant: measures how likely change was due to experiment,

<0.5 means statistically significant

Effect Size: how much one variable effects the other

  

E. Evaluating Research

Replication: repeated hypothesis testing, using many methods/groups

  

Ethical Research Guidelines:¬†

1. obtain informed consent
    
2. protect participants from harm and discomfort
    
3. protect confidentiality
    
4. make participation voluntary
    
5. do not use deception/incomplete disclosure
    
6. provide complete debriefing
    

  

Only use animals if

1. contribute to betterment of humans and animals
    
2. only if no alternative
    
3. humane, smallest amount exposure possible
    
4. limit pain/distress
    

Lecture Week 3: Neuroscience

  

Neurons: electrically excitable cells that process and transmit information through electrical and chemical signals, in brain/spinal cord/PNS, single cell

Nerve: group of neurons¬†

1. sensory neuron: allow you to have senses, stimulus from environment
    
2. motor neuron: allow you to move, send message to brain to move limbs, longest because limb distance
    
3. interneurons: between sensory and motor neurons, helps send message, shorter
    

  

Nervous System:

1. Neuron: conduct electrochemical signals and messaging
    

-very delicate, regenerate in some areas but frail

-basic unit of nervous system, communication between environment and body\

1. afferent neuron: PNS to CNS
    
2. efferent neuron: CNS to PNS
    
3. interneuron: relay between neuron types to help messages get across
    

Parts of Neuron:

1. Dendrite: branches that receive messages
    
2. Cell Body (soma): keeping cell alive, DNA (nucleus), protein synthesis and energy production
    
3. Axon: conducts impulses away from cell body to axon terminals to release neurotransmitters to space in between (synapse)
    
4. Axon Terminal: end of axon with synaptic vesicles
    
5. Myelin Sheath: fatty material insulating electrical impulses for faster transmission (and to avoid messages getting mixed up)
    

Multiple Sclerosis: deteriorating myelin sheath (motor issues, vision issues, major pain)

1. Nodes of Ranvier: gaps in myelin sheath, allow electrical impulses to jump gap to gap to move faster
    

  

2. Glial Cells: support, nurture, insulate neurons, remove debris when neurons die, enhance formation and maintenance of neural connections, modify neural functioning (decide which neural pathway gets stronger/weaker)
    

-10-50x more glial cells than neurons

1. microglia
    
2. oglioglia
    
3. something else
    

4 main functions:

1. surround and hold neurons in place
    
2. supply nutrients and oxygen
    
3. insulate one neuron from another (so no chemical/electrical confusion)
    
4. clean up dead neurons
    

  

How Neurons Work:

Electrical Impulses:

1. Resting Potential: neuron at rest
    

-polarized: negatively charged inside (intracellular) relative to outside (extracellular)

-about -65 to -70mV

-more potassium inside and sodium outside (semipermeable membrane ion channels/gates keeping most of sodium out and potassium in)

2. Action Potential: neurons firing
    

-pores open to let sodium in and potassium out

-neuron becomes more positive inside and negative outside, upset balance leads to neuron firing

-electrical impulse travels to end of axon terminal to open vesicles of neurotransmitters to release into synapse¬†

-about 40 to 50 mV

  

Absolute Threshold: once reaches threshold it fires, all or none, a firing is a firing

Refractory Period: time following action potential before another action potential can occur (neuron returning to original polarized state)

  

Chemical Messaging:

-neurotransmitters play fundamental role in communication between neurons, the electric impulse is just to stimulate neurotransmitter release

Synapse/Synaptic Transmission: information sent from one neuron to the next

1. Presynaptic Neuron (sending): axon terminal buttons have synaptic vesicles with neurotransmitters that are released after action potential
    
2. Postsynaptic Neuron (receiving): dendrites have receptor sites, receptors fit certain neurotransmitters
    

-some don‚Äôt make it (cleaned up), some reuptake, some fit into receiving neuron

SSRIAntidepressant: reuptake inhibitor to prevent sending neuron from reuptaking serotonin so there is more available to receiving neuron¬†

ADHD Medication: prevent dopamine uptake in receiving neuron

Neural Networks: webs of neurons forming from experience (fire together, wire together)

  

Neurotransmitters:

1. Dopamine: focus, controlling movement (ADHD, Parkinson‚Äôs)
    
2. Serotonin: mood (Depression)
    

-pathways in brain where neurotransmitters usually go

  

The Nervous System:

1. CNS: brain and spinal cord
    

-transmits messages from brain to PNS/muscles/glands

-receives/processes messages from PNS

1. Spinal Cord: bridge between brain/body below neck, 18‚Äù long, base of brain to waist
    

Spinal Reflexes: enabled by spinal nerves, bypass brain for faster reaction (outside of consciousness)

Spinal Nerves: PNS, go from spinal cord to body, 31 pairs connected to spinal cord pertaining to specific body areas (sensory one side, motor other side)

1. 8 cervical pairs (C1-C8)
    
2. 12 thoracic pairs (T1-T12)
    
3. 5 lumbar pairs (L1-L5)
    
4. 5 sacral paris

How The Brain Works:

Neuron: cell body with cytoplasm, organelles, nucleus

1. Dendrite: branches receiving inputs from other neurons
    
2. Axon: stem sending information from cell body towards other neurons, different size/structure depending on use
    

1. Axon Terminal: where signal is passed through synapse to other neurons‚Äô dendrites
    

Glia: take care of neurons (barriers, establish/maintain/rebuild synapses, modulate neuronal connection)

- ~ same amount in brain as neurons (more in some places like cerebral cortex where outnumbers 3 or 4 to 1)

1. Astroglia: creates Blood-Brain Barrier: keeps viruses and bacteria out of CNS), star-shaped, help heal brain injury, absorb chemicals released by neighbouring neurons, regulate flow of blood in different brain regions
    
2. Oligodendroglia (CNS) and Schwann Cells (PNS): myelinating glia
    

Myelin: fatty sheath insulating neurons from nearby neuronal activity, speeds up

passage of information down axon

Multiple Sclerosis: immune system attacks myelin

3. Ependymal Cells/Microglia: line walls of ventricles, secrete cerebrospinal fluid , clean up debris of degenerating/dead neurons and glia
    

  

How Neurons Work:

Neuron: process all motor, cognitive sensory information that enters/leaves/is created in CNS

-200 types, 86 billion in brain, communicate with 5000-200,000 quadrillion synapses![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/4ACJQkTTrj_LM48XHeyBydPUoIsdcJEnR9l9rJ3K4SyRpbj9XsdDVzBIMIrrGUKWxwyv9xcgbIE1xf8chJRaKgYO9Yu9Y_emrQSaeMPWaiNtAsn2H7L32hKsmFn-nOyey8NRkeeOxXao5jy2uSEPrxQ)

  
  

Resting Potential: not doing anything, in balance

-polarized, negative charge on axon

Ion: charged atom

1. Semipermeable Membrane: lets in certain ions
    
2. Electrostatic Pressure: force driving opposite charges together and similar charges apart
    
3. Concentration Gradient: different concentration of Sodium ions inside and outside neuron
    
4. Sodium Potassium Pumps: proteins regulating amount of sodium and potassium in neurons (push sodium out, pull potassium in)![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/2QL7y2diVeINnEGxZuEj80k8EWe0Ofva6njDfS4pY0BqxMq3qhv5Rw9ydK0pDpsYD3coGKK78vwyyHZeC4vkUFO_U780MGE5xgdJPEgS_FtK8AJAi8bYC6Xjs197MP_YoigbcOrsncJr5qGDUxyKyro)
    

  

Action Potential: sudden change of charge in neuron‚Äôs axon (spike/firing transmitted down axon)

-occurs when enough sodium enters cell to polarize it¬†

Threshold: point where influence of other neurons succeed in causing another neuron to have action potential (-40mV)

-sodium rushes in until neuron axon is positively charged, then potassium rushes out to repolarize

Absolute Refractory Period: brief period after action potential when neuron is unable to fire

Relative Refractory Period: brief period after ARP where neuron can fire if has stronger stimuli than threshold

-more action potentials = more intense response¬†

Myelin: fatty white substance formed from glial cells, insulates some axons of neurons, action potential jumps node to node with gaps (Nodes of Ranvier) in middle where sodium rushes in (when channels open)

  

Communication Across the Synapse:

-positive charge of action potential reaches axon terminal, initiates actions passing information to dendrites of other neurons

Synapse: space between acxon terminals and dendrites of other neurons where chemical communication occurs

Neurotransmitters: specialized chemicals traveling across synapses to allow neuron communication

Synaptic Vesicles: membrane-bound spheres in axon terminal that store neurotransmitters.¬†

-binding synaptic vesicles with presynaptic membrane allows release

  

Role of Neurotransmitters:

CA2+: when action potential reaches axon terminal CA channels open allowing Ca in, critical to binding of synaptic vesicles to presynaptic cell membrane of axon terminals

Cl-1

Neurotransmitter Receptors: proteins in neuron membranes that bind to neurotransmitters in lock & key method recognizing specific molecules¬†

Electrical Event: neurotransmitter binds to receptor in postsynaptic membrane

Postsynaptic Potentials:

1. Excitatory: allows sodium ion channel to open, postsynaptic cell depolarized (less negative inside than outside) (Glutamate)
    
2. Inhibitory: lets chlorine flow in, postsynaptic cell becomes hyperpolarized (more negative than outside) (GABA)
    

-release of neurotransmitters affects number/sensitivity of neurochemical receptors

  

Termination of Neurotransmitter Activity at Synapse:

-once neurotransmitter released into synaptic cleft, communication is halted by:

1. enzymatic degradation: breaking down remaining neurotransmitters in synaptic cleft by specialized enzymes and proteins (taken back to make new)
    
2. reuptake: functional neurotransmitter molecules drawn back into presynaptic neurons and recycles for future use
    

Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI): limit serotonin reuptake so more available in

synapse, elevated mood

  

Function of Neurotransmitters:

1. Acetylcholine (acy): stimulating muscles, communication between motor/sensory neurons, attention, arousal, memory, REM sleep
    

-widespread loss key in ALtzheimer‚Äôs, snake venom interrupts communication and release (paralysis), Botox reduces wrinkles by interrupting nerve cell signal for muscle to contract

2. Dopamine: mood, voluntary movement, reward mechanisms
    

-too much: schizophrenia, too little: parkinson‚Äôs

3. Norepinephrine: stimulating SNS (arousal, vigilance, mood), learning, memory, sleep, emotion
    

-high: anxiety, low: depression

4. Serotonin: mood, appetite, sleep, pain perception, activity level, cognitive functions (learning/memory)
    
5. GABA: reduces activity of neuron it binds to, sleep, reduction of arousal in nervous system
    

-abnormal levels: eating disorders and epilepsy

-benzos (valium) for anxiety mimic GABA and bind to receptors to reduce activity level

6. Glutamate: most important for normal brain functioning, released by up to half of brain neurons, learning, memories
    

-excessive: huntington‚Äôs disease: inherited, death in neurons in striatum (awkward movements, psychosis)¬†

  

Neural Networks: millions fire together in neural circuits/networks

Cell Assemblies: begin as random connections, become organized to work together as unit, strengthened as behaviour repeated (Hebbian synapses after Hebb)

Neuroplasticity: behaviour and experience can physically alter the brain, capacity to create new neural pathways from experience of recovery from injury

-hippocampus, olfactory bulb, cerebellum, prefrontal cortex can make new brain cells into adulthood

Synaptic Plasticity: plasticity at synapse, changes occurring from neurotransmitter release

Brain Lateralization:

-epileptioc seizure: caused by action potentials spreading from one side of brain to other, split brain procedure to limit speed and severity (can‚Äôt say what something is if holding in left hand)

Corpus Callosum: bundle of axons allowing lateral communication across hemispheres

-most people have speech/language (Wernike and Broca‚Äôs areas) on left side but some left handers have it on right side or both sides¬†

-everything we do involves both sides

  

Chapter 4: Sensation and Perception

  

-all sensations are a result of sensory receptor energy being converted into neural impulses transmitted to brain

Sensation: using sensory receptors to detect stimulus

Perception: interpreting and identifying stimulus

Transduction: transformation of physical energy in environment to electrical signals in the brain

  

A. Common Features of Sensation and Perception:

LO: characteristics shared by all senses (receptor cells, transduction, thresholds), top down v. bottom up processing

  

1. Sensory Receptor Cells: specialized cells that convert specific form of environmental stimulus into neural impulse
    

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/lfzTmvhnBbvJWLOpk-TULuwiB7FiMrOStd9wxY-SSftWIL4mExoCjGTSAyDXj7fbP_dcG0gvAhCsPbAqgJcWR_GpvGSanT1yRMC-xK5Cjo5qPQG7lPvCeQdBjRNGdeS7Gw7kyFJoDl7djAlchmkbqWM)

2. Sensory Transduction: process of converting specific form of environmental signal into neural impulses
    

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/5tiSRnQhfLFmy7jRyh_QfrCL4LvroLXtw_3nM9vm2XkukBHKKGeS2AysjuQG9ithKMMOsep84_4lXOs_mlqQtSn25X4hpxL4FVv4oK-tZKaVm3I33Ia326H-_ckhdbxwgDzkg-C-grTAtrlUnKkClbs)

3. Thresholds: must reach threshold to activate sensory receptors
    

1. Absolute Threshold: minimum stimulus needed for detection 50% of the time
    

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/p6KDXm1v8Qzyl8sBJq7tCw784YDzO9hmbQyC8Qack9k1ZLIk5oAGe9-it1W2Gso2-xzez54pcgupED1r72EMFxZKyg74-pQJHnip94aZHiqU5zYBpCnRNt2m8xtGGiUhDLyUWqra5a1OwPq-1I386xg)

2. Difference Threshold/Just Noticeable Difference: minimal difference between 2 stimuli necessary for distinction of difference
    

Signal Detection Theory: response to signal depends on ability to differentiate between signal and noise and response criteria (experience, expectation, consequences for failure)

4. Sensory Adaptation: repeated stimuli yield a decreased response, we detect change
    

Olfactory Adaptation: ability to detect odours fades as exposed

  

Processing Sensory Information:

1. Bottom-Up Processing: perception beginning with physical stimuli from environment being transduced into neural impulses and moving to increasingly complex brain regions
    
2. Top-Down Processing: perception lead by previous experience and expectations
    

Perceptual Sets: readiness to interpret certain stimulus a certain way

  

B. The Senses

  

1. The Auditory Sense: Hearing: converting sound waves into neural impulses
    

Sound Waves: vibrations of air in the frequency of hearing

1. Frequency: pitch, number of cycles in certain time, Hertz (Hz)
    
2. Amplitude: loudness, strength of given cycle, decibels (dB)
    

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/V9Iq7h06ydTLu5-nUALmcbCxDt9Zj-IvaOEJmt_WccuzG--krcKtWX7kx7_Bk3WqJSzGqUi7YMlMUIOJA5-FDUaU6pfAcbY0HeojRKrg_HaEyZeW2f-NkL2xwsFccpgaGgAz1Cr5ZITOgRb7fe0zq2g)

Process:

1. sound waves enter outer ear at deepest part, deflect Tympanic Membrane (ear drum)
    
2. vibrations of tympanic membrane make Ossicles (tiny bones in ear called malleus (hammer), icus (anvil) and stapes (stirrup)) move, stapes hits Oval Window: membrane separating ossicles and inner ear
    
3. deflection of oval window causes wave in Cochlea (fluid-filled structure containing hair cells) of inner ear, deflects Basilar Membrane (running down middle of cochlea) covered with row of Hair Cells (auditory sensory receptors)
    
4. movements bend hair cells that transduce fluid sound wave into electrical activity, communicate with cochlear nerve to send neural impulses to brain
    
5. neural impulses travel to brain stem, thalamus, primary auditory cortex in temporal lobe
    

Topographic Map: impulse sent to specific part of auditory cortex depending on pitch

6. moves to auditory association areas in cortex to link sounds to language and¬†
    
7. objects and synch with other sensory modalities
    

  

Identifying Frequency and Pitch:

1. Frequency Theory: different frequencies mean different rates of action potentials (higher frequency = higher action potential)
    

-does not account for all of hearing

2. Place Theory: frequencies activate different places on the basilar membrane and are encoded based on where they originated.
    

-accounts for more of hearing

Absolute Pitch: ability to produce/recognize note on any musical scale

Amusia: tone deaf

  

Sound Adaptation:

1. ears adapt to loud sounds by contracting to let in less sound wave (also happens when we talk)
    
2. hair cells less sensitive to continuous noises (permanent hearing loss)
    
3. brain can filter out unimportant loud sounds (cocktail party effect)
    

  

Locating Sounds in Space:

-general loudness: louder = closer

-loudness in each ear: closer ear hears louder (direction)

-timing: closer ear hears first, sound wave hits at different cycles (direction)

  

Hearing Development:

-capable of transducing sound before birth, prefer speech sounds and mother‚Äôs voice

-topographic map organized in sensitive period, can still learn after just harder

  

Hearing Loss:

1. Conduction Deafness: break in sound transmission process (wax buildup, infection, eardrum damage, water)
    
2. Nerve Deafness: damage/malformations of auditory nerve (occurs from birth)
    

-sign language, cochlear implants

  

2. The Visual Sense: Sight: converting electromagnetic radiation (light) into neural impulses
    

-light made of photon particles traveling in waves

-different wavelength = different colour

-reflect more light = brighter

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/KQ5Mu5pxZlzke9sh3HTlApBHe085Oz38mroWmwIg5nlTzuhqICg81rFD_Px6Btiokf9JWtO868u3EySNtmpljCjtPgoTnXLkyXTl8C5ISUB4avnd7_JAs2OF329B4nERD76qdPEUdr197jmECvwEZdE)

Seeing Light:

1. muscles of iris adjust shape of cornea lens (focus) and size of pupil (adjust amount of light)
    
2. light reaches photoreceptors, rods/cones stimulate bipolar cells that cause ganglion cells to fire.
    

Retina: sheet of specialized nerve cells in back of eye containing sensory receptors for vision

Photoreceptors: sensory receptor for vision, in retina

1. Cones: sensitive to colours (respond to different wavelengths), fewer (4.5 - 6 million), only in fovea (see clearer)
    
2. Rods: sensitive to light, no colour, more (100 million), around periphery
    

-nocturnal = only rods, dinural = only cones

3. signals travel along Optic Nerve (axons of ~ 1 million ganglion cells) to brain
    

Blind Spot/Optic Disk: where optic nerve attaches to retina, no rods or cones, filled in by other eye and brain

4. signals travel to superior colliculus, communicate with thalamus to primary visual cortex (see lines/edges) in occipital lobe, then to association areas (objects)
    

-fovea input sent to opposite side of brain, periphery sent to same side

1. What Pathway: identifies object (axons occipital to temporal lobe)
    

-damage to temporal lobe = Visual Agnosia: cannot identity seen objects

Prosopagnosia: cannot identify faces

2. Where Pathway: identifies object in space (axons occipital to parietal lobe)
    

-damage to parietal lobe = can‚Äôt coordinate objects in space

Hemi-Neglect: ignore one side of visual field (opposite of what side injured)

Visual Adaptation: adapt to brighter light with pupil constriction

  

Seeing Colour: colour only exists in brain

Hue: wavelength/type¬†

Saturation: purity

Brightness: how much light it reflects

  

Theories of Colour Perception:

1. Young-Helmholtz Trichromatic Theory:
    

-3 colours of cones (yellow/red, green, blue/purple), sensitive to different wavelengths of light

2. Hering Opponent-Process Theory:
    

-colour pairs (red-green, yellow-blue, white-black) that inhibit each other, cannot mix certain colours

Negative Afterimage: one colour inhibits the other, when removed the other overcompensates in opponent colour

  

Colour Blindness:

1. Colour Vision Deficiency: unable to differentiate some colours (shortage of some cones)
    
2. Monochromacy: see world in black and white
    

  

Top-Down Visual Perceptual Organization:

1. Gestalt Principles: put together pieces to make meaning from vision
    

1. figure/ground
    
2. proximity
    
3. similarity
    
4. continuity
    
5. closure
    

3. Binocular/Monocular Cues: depth perception
    

1. Binocular Cues (3D): both eyes
    

-Retinal Disparity: slightly offset image in each eye (to judge distance)

-Tactile: closer requires Convergence (inward eye movement)

2. Monocular Cues (2D): one eye
    

-interposition (blocking)

-relative height/elevation

-texture gradient

-linear perspective

-light/shadow

-clarity/aerial perspective

-familiar size

-relative size

-motion parallax (closer things move faster when you‚Äôre moving)

3. Perceptual Constancy: view objects as unchanging despite environmental shifts
    

1. Colour Constancy: see same colour regardless of lighting
    
2. Size Constancy: expect to stay same (see moon bigger when lower cause have things to compare it to)
    
3. Shape Constancy: recognize objects
    

  

Developing Sight:

-see only high contrast at first

-2mo can see faces within 1‚Äô

-8mo similar vision to adults

  

Vision Loss:

1. Strabismus: misaligned eyes so ignore weaker eye (can lead to permanent vision loss if not corrected)
    
2. Amblyopia: vision loss due to abnormal development of visual cortex, can be from ignoring one eye (if not corrected by 6 years = permanent vision loss)
    
3. Visual Impairment:
    

-braille (use visual brain to process tactile information, more if started young)

-if born blind, visual cortex responds to touch/sound/language¬†

  

3. Vestibular and Kinetic Sense:
    

1. Kinesthetic Sense: receptors in muscles respond if squeezed/shape changed by movement
    
2. Vestibular Sense: canals of inner ear fluid shifts as we move, detected bu hairs
    

-when matches with other sensory input feel good, when doesn‚Äôt match feel sick

  

Lecture Week 6: Consciousness

  

Consciousness: awareness of internal (thinking) and external (environment) stimuli

-all human behaviour comes from a mixture of conscious and unconscious processing

James: stream of consciousness (constantly changing)

Freud: first to recognize different levels of consciousness, continue to impact you until you become aware

-attention and consciousness are closely related but you can have one without the other

Mind Wandering: doing a task automatically so brain takes a break and thinks of something else

Default Network: diffuse network of neurons for repetitive, repeated tasks

  

Forms of Consciousness:

1. Spontaneous (daydreaming, drowsiness, dreaming)
    
2. Physiologically Induced (hallucinations, orgasm, food/oxygen deprivation)
    
3. Psychologically Induced (sensory deprivation, hypnosis, meditation)
    

  

Levels of Consciousness:

1. Full: know and can report on mental state
    
2. Self: attention drawn to self as an object (aware of something and aware others may be aware of it)
    
3. Minimal: sensory input registering but not aware of it
    

  

Finding Levels: Testing:

Tests:

1. EEG: measures brain electrical activity (sleep brain waves)
    
2. fMRI: do tests in machine to see what brain regions wake up
    
3. PET: expensive full-colour scan of activity
    

  

Hypnosis/Anesthesia can teach about consciousness: controllable altered states, accessing other levels of consciousness)

  

Processes in Brain: exchange information with thalamus

1. Sensory Network: perception, outermost layer of prefrontal cortex, temporal loba, parietal lobe)
    
2. Internal Self Consciousness Network: internal voice, deep in cortex
    

  

Brain Damage:

1. Comas: unconscious, unresponsive, unaware, unarousable¬†
    

-no sleep/wake cycle

-no pain/reactions

-induced by brain damage in cerebral hemispheres of upper/lower brain and reticular activating system in brain stem

-last a few days-weeks

-may open eyes but not conscious

-gradually come out, start responding to external stimuli

  

2. Vegetative State: unresponsive to physical/psychological stimuli
    

-often caused by lack of oxygen (anoxia), can happen from heart attack

-can have periods of alertness (move, groan, reflexive action)

-lower brain spared from damage but higher parts damaged (likely beyond repair)

  

3. Persistent Vegitative State: after 30 days unaroused
    

-better outcomes the sooner you wake up

-only 50% coming out (adults), 60% kids

  

4. Stupor: unresponsive but can be aroused by pain (severe drunkenness)
    

  

5. Locked In Syndrome: awake/fully conscious but paralyzed, can only blink
    

-lower brain regions no damage

  

6. Brain Death: axons torn and cannot send messages
    

-happens to minority of comatose people

-don‚Äôt die but don‚Äôt recover

  

Anesthesia:

-used to be thought of as ‚Äògoing under‚Äô, old brain comes back before higher functions

-actually path to unconsciousness and back to consciousness is not the same (no one brain region for consciousness)

-don‚Äôt really know we transition from conscious to unconscious state

Unconscious: wave of alpha waves from back to front

Conscious: wave of alpha waves from front to back

Alpha Waves: low frequency oscillations, produce unconsciousness by disrupting communication between brain regions and constraining amount of information that can be sent in brain

-coordination of brain regions is what makes consciousness

  

Brain Waves:

-amplitude (height)

-frequency (cycles per second, correlated to cycles)

1. Beta (13-24 cps): alertness, problem solving, normal waking thought
    
2. Alpha (8-12 cps): resting, relaxation, meditation
    
3. Theta (4-7 cps): low alertness, light sleep
    
4. Delta (<4 cps): deep dreamless sleep, where a lot of restorative functions of sleep happen
    

  

Circadian Rhythm: biological clock in every cell for body rhythms (sleep/wake, hormones, blood pressure)

Suprachiasmatic Nuclei: orients to day/night cycles of light (body needs light to have a rhythm)

Physiological Pathway of Biological Clock:

1. light
    
2. retina
    
3. suprachiasmatic nucleus (hypothalamus)
    

  

Sleep:

-don‚Äôt move because part of brain in frontal lobe deactivates so don‚Äôt act out dreams, logic part turned off)

  

Learning About Sleep:

1. EEG: brain waves/muscle movement during sleep
    

  

Stages of Sleep:

1. brief transitional (1-7 minutes): alpha to theta waves, hypnic jerks
    
2. sleep spindles/k complexes (10-25 minutes)
    
3. slow wave sleep (30 minutes): delta waves
    
4. REM sleep:
    

-EEG similar to awake

-breathing rapid/irregular, eyes move

-needed for learning, different kinds of sleep may relate to different learning

Dreams: mental experiences during sleep

-learning opportunities, work things out, offer solutions, allow to test them out

-content usually familiar

-common themes

-waking life spillover/residue

Lucid Dreaming: very sharp real feeling dream you can control

Sleep Paralysis: paralyzed but hallucinating but awake (brain letting some of the world in, some brain parts unresponsive)

-as you approach morning, deep sleep shortens and REM sleep gets longer

  

Age and Sleep:

-15-24 greatest sleep time

-33-44 least sleep time (time stress)

-newborns 6-8x in 24 hours (16-17 hours a day) (cultures where carried sleep less), more than 50% in REM (for learning, even more if deprived)

-old = least sleep (pain, napping, going to bathroom)

  

Why Do We Sleep?

-protective role in human evolution

-brain restoration/neuron repair

-store/rebuild memories of the day

-promotes creative problem solving

-encourages growth through pituitary gland hormone secretion

  

Brain Structures:

-ascending reticular activating system

-pons, medulla, thalamus, hypothalamus, limbic system (emotions)

  

Neurotransmitters:

-acetylcholine, serotonin (mood)

-dopamine, norepinephrine, GABA (alertness)

  

Sleep Deprivation:

-like drunk (fatigue, difficulty concentrating, creativity, communication)

-can lead to obesity, hypertension, suppressed immune system

-irritability and slowed performance

-impacts memory, reaction time, decision making, motor coordination, immune system, emotional regulation

-3-4 days max without sleep

  

Insomnia: difficulty falling/staying asleep

Sleep Apnea: person stops breathing for brief periods during night

Somnambulism: walks around during sleep

Narcolepsy: sudden sleep attacks

Sleep Paralysis: waking in a dream unable to move

Night Terrors: abrupt awakenings with panic/intense emotional arousal (not from a dream)

REM Sleep Behaviour Disorder: act out dreams

  

Sleeping Pills:

-become dependent so need increased dose to still work

  

‚Äúi‚Äôm just going to keep going until i get better‚Äù

-girl sitting behind me

  

Chapter 6: Consciousness:

  

1. Awake: Consciousness:
    

LO: levels of conscious awareness, key brain structures and associated functions

  

Consciousness: immediate awareness of internal and external states

-conscious awareness is adaptive (allows you to take care of needs)

Altered State of Consciousness: change in ability to be fully aware of in/external states (sleep, dream, hypnosis, meds, anesthetic, drugs)

Studying Consciousness:

1. States of Consciousness: level of awareness
    
2. Content of Consciousness: what you are aware of
    

Attention: possible prerequisite for consciousness (need to be aware and paying

attention)

Inattentional Blindness: don‚Äôt see what not paying attention to

  

Components in Brain:

1. Reticular Formation: sleep and wake (when damaged can‚Äôt stay awake) (attending to)
    
2. Thalamus and Hypothalamus: (attending to)
    

Thalamus: links to sensory/motor areas of cortex for conscious awareness of surroundings

Hypothalamus: sends signals from reticular formation to cortex to maintain awake/attentive state

3. Cerebral Cortex: controls what information one is aware of
    

-right side = nonverbal conscious awareness

  

Development and Consciousness:

Rouge Test: see if have concept of self (by 18 mo)

-consciousness rooted in language, representation and social responsiveness

-22 mo shift, can name/categorize concepts and reason inductively

  

2. Awake: Preconscious and Unconscious:
    

LO: summarize ideas of preconscious/unconscious

  

Preconscious: level of awareness where info can become consciously available if necessary

Unconscious State: information not easily accessible to conscious awareness

1. Cognitive View of Unconscious:
    

2 kinds of memory, use different brain pathways

1. Explicit Memory: knowledge we are fully aware of, can recall at will
    
2. Implicit Memory: knowledge we are not fully aware of, cannot recall at will but use in life (skill acquisition, automatic actions and solutions)
    

2. Freud‚Äôs View of Unconscious: (nonscientific)
    

-vast majority of personal knowledge is in unconscious, houses thoughts/memories too painful/disturbing for consciousness (reporessed)

Freudian Slip: mind allows repressed thought into consciousness

-repress too much and you develop psychological disorders

-more complex than Freud envisioned, data doesn‚Äôt match

3. Asleep:
    

LO: key themes of sleep/dreams, sleep problems affecting functioning

  

Function of Sleep:

1. Adaptive Theory: sleep for self preservation, to keep safe from predators
    
2. Restorative Theory: sleep to restore chemical resources and eliminate chemical wastes
    

  
![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/lPfJ87rFeyuz8I0FXGPu6JFdQYz-YaZeEJB9-lIBTbVESaks_UMDO3zZ9GYj1IabQ3zsuq8EJDXGXJb2n7v22_iWRbeNMmbeH3g6Kg7E573h64R2M1yaqKxsO7EtsAaIe96pv0t5UrKwZ4LqaNeOrAw)

Rhythms of Sleep:

Circadian Rhythm: sleep wake cycle/pattern in humans roughly corresponding to

daylight

-temperature rises until midday, then drops (fatigue), rises again and drops (sleep)

-most alert in late morning, then drops and rises again

-also regulates changes in blood pressure, hormone secretion, pain sensitivity

Owls and Larks: genetically/gender/health determined

-every cell has own internal clock influenced by stress/health/nutrition

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/KXKfQ5EGwaRj0YcqW8QGK8ox2_fgpFbFaDHNmLRZIwycSv9QCGHOy-BPR3vIgVukf_Czz4Xze8UhM1e7no0YOpoCTpnaxjPIyvOBZnus0My7YqSMY5UYw9uOeJto9koy3a6x6mR2DDB7f7zy_hmNMB4)

Hormonal Influence:

Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN): group of neurons in hypothalamus coordinating

bodily rhythms

-less sun, SCN directs pineal gland to secrete melatonin (sleepiness)

-more sun, photoreceptors send signal to SCN, melatonin drops

-artificial light, shift work, crossing time zones impacts circadian rhythm

-when rhythm disrupted all body systems are out of synch

  

Sleep Patterns:

-cycle every 90-100 mins for first half of night, second half spent in first 2 stages (REM sleep)

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/bnCXpyhSl6hSvbqZ5SJzCEJ20g5ezqG7fxoy7wtdYmbq53XwcHk_Y-aH51azOIlqEUN-KTs4Oq2F4NUXG9tWAXgVisIo3lMbHBfykHMlLuOINrZRG6-zFBbqgWxECbBi-KWLEPuuPcc1sbRTOP9I3VU)

0. Hypnagogic State: pre-sleep period, vivid sensory phenomena (hypnagogic hallucinations), alpha waves

NON REM SLEEP:

1. Stage 1 Sleep (theta waves): bridge of awake and asleep, a few minutes
    
2. Stage 2 Sleep: Sleep Spindles: bursts of brain activity for 1-2 seconds, 15-20 minutes, easily awakened
    
3. Stage 3 Sleep (20-50% delta waves)
    
4. Stage 4 Sleep (mostly delta waves): heart rate/blood pressure/ breathing rate drop to lowest levels, still, sleepwalking happens here
    

REM Sleep: jagged/rapid brainwaves, increased heart rate/breathing, rapid eye

movements, dreaming

-brain behaves as if awake

-consolidation of memories and newly learned material

-every kind of mammal and birds experience REM and NREM sleep

  

Dreams:

-run in real time

1. Information-Processing Theory: mind‚Äôs attempt to sort out day‚Äôs experiences, fix them into memory (REM longer if stressful day or learned lots)
    
2. Activation-Synthesis Hypothesis: brain‚Äôs attempt to organize random internally generated signals with meaning
    
3. Freudian Dream Theory: represent unconscious wishes/desires, discharging energy associated with unacceptable feelings
    

1. Manifest Content: what people recall (literal)
    
2. Latent Content: unconscious elements (meaning)
    

  

Nightmares: more common in children/anxious/stressed

Lucid Dreams: recognize they are dreaming and control outcome

Daydream: fantasy interrupting awake consciousness in the day

  

Sleep Pattern Change Over Development:

-babies have more REM sleep than adults (aids in CNS/motor development)

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/R276KFH4JBGkC6OfwpIJZ3FLQBmJ-olazLc14Owx2tvtOhXAV4QxKxRBJ_LyvdqY526-mmv5dnyvPfL466k3SG9-M7AXxwhG03UW8O927VRKcwo4iicsbk31qReC3CChymDvGAEQjTaSj2BN_dzuw6E)

Sleep Deprivation:

-most would sleep 9-10 hours if left unhindered

-general depressed state (disrupting sleep), lower productivity, more mistakes,

easily distractible, not as adaptive, lower immune response, heart health,

metabolic issues

  

Sleep Disorders:

1. Insomnia: regularly cannot fall/stay asleep (stress)
    
2. Sleep-Related Breathing Disorders:
    

Sleep Apnea: ceasing to breath, depriving brain of oxygen and causing awakening

3. Central Disorders of Hypersomnolence: excessive daytime sleepiness
    

Narcolepsy: uncontrollable urge to fall asleep

4. Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders: delayed ability to fall asleep/wake up
    
5. Sleep-Related Movement Disorders:
    

Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS): uncontrollable urge to move legs

Periodic Limb Movements of Sleep (PLMS): moving uncontrollably during sleep

6. Parasomnias: sleepwalking
    

  

Lecture Week 8: Learning

  

Learning: process of enduring adaptive behaviour based on experiences, anticipation of what‚Äôs to come

  

Behaviorism: view of psychology as an observable science, no examination of mental processes

1. Pavlov: 1st to use scientific method to study associative learning
    

-studied digestive system for 2 decades

-accidentally discovered CC through work on dog salivation (won Nobel prize for physiology 1904)

-investigated further for 2 decades, some of most important findings in psychology

2. Watson: tortured child (little Albert)
    
3. Skinner: rats
    

  

1. Non-Associative Learning: not associating stimuli, just a response to a single stimulus/event
    

1. Habituation: decreased response to repeated stimuli exposure
    
2. Dishabituation: recovery of attention to novel stimulus following habituation
    
3. Sensitization: strong stimulus results in exaggerated response to weaker stimuli
    

3. Associative Learning: most learning is associative
    

1. Classical Conditioning: association between two unrelated stimuli
    

1. UCS: stimulus with reflexive response
    
2. UR: reflexive response
    
3. CS: starts as neutral stimulus with no response¬†
    
4. CR: same as UR but learned
    

-if you wait too long, association broken

Acquisition Phase: when neutral stimulus and UCS paired more often

-strongest/fastest acquisition when half second delay

Learning Trial: stimulus pairings

Extinction: reduction of CR after repeated presentations of CS alone

Spontaneous Recovery: relearning CR after extinction is faster than starting from

scratch (suppressed not eliminated)

1. Generalization responding similarly to stimuli close to CS (adaptive)
    
2. Discrimination: loss of generalization, only respond to specific CS¬†
    

Higher-Order Conditioning: using CS as UCS to make another CS (can only do 2

layers)

Application:

-former drug users crave drugs when they are in same environment/with same people, this context acts as CS, triggering CR of taking drugs

-also rehab can do this, addicts together triggering each other

-this is why recovery is so hard

  

2. Operant Conditioning:
    

  

Chapter 7: Learning

  

1. What is Learning?
    

Learning: lasting changes caused by experience, inferred by behaviour

-historically animals studied for learning, humans for memory

1. Non-Associative: not linking stimuli
    

1. Habituation: reduced response from repeated stimulus, frees up cognitive resources for important things (decreased habituation in mental disorders, over vigilant, unable to filter things out)
    
2. Sensitization: recovery of attention to novel stimulus after habituation
    

3. Associative Learning: linking 2 stimuli together, most of learning
    

  

2. Classical Conditioning:
    

Conditioning: association of two events in environment

Classical Conditioning: associating two unrelated stimuli resulting in learned results

Pavlov: studied reflexes to study psychic ability objectively

Natural Reflex: hardwired response, present at birth

-dogs salivate when seeing lab assistants, not food

How it Works:

Unconditioned Stimulus (US): causes reflexive response

Unconditioned Response (UR): reflexive response from US

Conditioned Stimulus (CS): paired with US to cause UR response

Conditioned Response (CR): learned response from CS, same as UR

Processes:

1. learning stronger when high CS-US pairing
    
2. timing matters (CS half second before US)
    

Stimulus Generalization: stimuli similar to CS trigger CR

Stimulus Discrimination: do not have CR from similar stimuli

Higher Order Conditioning: CS acts as US for another stimuli

Extinction: previously learned CR is inhibited when US does not happen (not

forgotten, just less response)

Spontaneous Recovery: reemergence of CR after extinction

Drug Dependency:

Tolerance: body adapts metabolically to drug so need bigger amount for same

high

-nervous system anticipates drug use based on location/process and can prepare

so can handle more drugs. When it does not have time to prepare compensatory

response (environment or preparation different) can overdose

Withdrawal: caused by body making compensatory response to drug cues,

leading to drug cravings

  

Aversion:

Fears: easily learned through conditioning

Watson: children can be formed into anything by conditioning

Little Albert experiment: becoming afraid of a rat (or dog, rabbit, fur coat, santa

beard) due to loud noise

Phobia: persistent, irrational, obsessive fear of object or situation (abnormal amygdala activity)

Conditioned Taste Aversion: food/taste elicits aversive reaction after paired with

illness (nausea or vomiting), biologically predisposed to do this

  

3. Operant Conditioning
    

Operant Conditioning: behaviour modified depending on consequences

Thorndike: cat in puzzle box

Law of Effect: repeat rewarding behaviours, stop unrewarding/neutral behaviours

  

How it Works:

Behaviourism: systematic study of manipulation of observable behaviour, all responses are conditioned by life

1. Reinforcement: increase likelihood of behaviour being repeated
    

Reinforcer: experience increasing behaviour (reward)

1. Positive: adding pleasant stimulus
    
2. Negative: removing unpleasant stimulus
    

1. Primary: satisfies biological needs
    
2. Secondary: learned rewarding stimulus (when associated with primary)
    

2. Punishment: decrease likelihood of behaviour being repeated
    

1. Positive: adding unpleasant consequence
    
2. Negative: removing pleasant stimulus
    

1. Primary: naturally aversive
    
2. Secondary: learned aversive stimulus (when associated with primary)
    

  

Schedules:

Continuous: reinforced every time (quickly acquired and extinguished)

Intermittent/Partial: reinforced sometimes (slower to acquire and extinguish)

1. Ratio Schedule: reinforcement based on number of behavioural responses
    

1. Fixed: rewarded every time do behaviour a set amount of times (loyalty card)
    
2. Variable: reinforced for predetermined average of responses (slots)
    

3. Interval Schedule: reinforcement based on elapsed time
    

1. Fixed: reinforced on set time interval
    
2. Variable: reinforced on randomly predetermined amount over time based on passage of average time since reinforcement
    

Teaching New Behaviours:

Shaping: reinforcing increasingly closer actions to desired behaviour

Behaviour Modification: systematic approach to change behaviour using operant

conditioning principles

Instinctive Drift: instinctive response interfered with conditioned behaviour

Learned Helplessness: repeated exposure to inescapable punishment results in

not trying to escape

  

4. Observational Learning:
    

Observational/Social Learning: learning from watching others (models), not by overt training

Modeling: what occurs when observer learns from model‚Äôs behaviour

Imitation: mimic/copy model‚Äôs behaviour

Aggression:

Bandura: Bobo doll experiment, more aggression if watch aggression and aggression being rewarded

Vicarious Learning: learning from observing consequences of others‚Äô actions

Mirror Neurons: neurons firing when performing action or seeing others perform action

  

5. Learning and Cognition:
    

Implicit Learning: acquisition of information without awareness

Spatial Navigational Learning: learning involving associating stimuli relevant to spatial navigation

Latent Learning: learning not expressed until rewarded/incentivized

Insight Learning: sudden realization of solution/understanding

  

6. Factors Facilitating Learning
    

1. Timing:
    

Semantic Learning: facts, need multiple exposures with intervals in between

Episodic Learning: events in our own lives

2. Context:
    

Context Effect: if information is learned/used in only one context it is less likely to be recalled elsewhere

-take test where learned knowledge = do better

3. Awareness and Attention:
    

Pop-Out: bottom up processing, significantly different stimuli pops out

Active Search: top down processing, draw on cognitive processes to actively attend

Stroop Effect: when info is contradictory, attending to one stimulus blocks attending to relevant task (colour/word mismatch)

4. Multitasking:
    

-having social media up in the background makes studying/work/attention less effective, need to pay attention to learn

5. Sleep:
    

-need sleep to encode memories of information learned and be aware to learn new

  

Lecture Week 10: Memory

  

Memory: capacity to retain and retrieve information

-reconstructive process, not exact copy, not unchanging

-without memory we lack a self

1. Encoding: transform experience (thoughts, sensations, feelings) into memory, shaped by past experiences/feelings
    

-more sensory avenues = better encoding

Levels of Processing: Craik & Lockhart

1. Visual/Structural: shallow, structural recognition (least likely to be remembered)
    
2. Phonological: intermediate, sounds
    
3. Semantic: deep, meanings of stimuli (most likely to be remembered)
    

-need to pay attention, focus awareness, selective attention (input) and not divide attention to encode¬†

1. Effortful Processing: careful attention and effort
    
2. Automatic Processing: remember without conscious awareness or effort
    

  

Organizational Encoding: categorizing information according to relationships among serieses of items (lays framework for new encoding and recognition)

Memory Palace: remembering 100s of words by placing them around a visualized house (pairing visual and linguistic memory)

Clustering/Conceptual Hierarchies: multi-level grouping by characteristics

Schemas: cluster of knowledge about object or event

Scripts: procedural schema about processes of common activities

Semantic Networks: nodes and clusters representing and linking concepts

Connectionist Networks: trying to always compare new information to connect it to existing schemas

PDP Models: brain is processing in many places at once

Enriching Encoding:

1. Elaboration: link information to pre-existing knowledge at time of encoding
    
2. Visual Imagery: creation of visual images to represent¬†
    
3. Self-Referent Encoding: making information personally meaningful (remember what‚Äôs important to us easier)
    

  
  

2. Storage: maintain information over time
    
3. Retrieval: access previously stored information
    

  

1. Information Processing: information goes through 3 memory stores in 3 sensory processes
    

1. Sensory Memory: information in original form sensed for a limited time¬†
    

-all is encoded but most is immediately forgotten

Iconic: visual (lasts ¬Ω second)

Echoic: auditory (lasts 2-4 seconds)

George Sperling (1960): showed letters for very limited time, ask how many are remembered (encode all but forget most before asked to recall)

  

2. Short Term Memory: holds information for temporary analysis
    

-20-30 seconds without rehearsal

Rehearsal: process of repetitively verbalizing and thinking about information

-5-9 items (3-5 nowadays)

Chunking: grouping similar stimuli for storage as single unit

  

b.5. Working Memory: mental scratchpad for doing processes with what‚Äôs in STM

-30 seconds if stop working with it

-supports other cognitive functions like problem solving, planning, interacting with LTM

1. Central Executive: monitor/coordinate WM system¬†
    

1. Phonological Loop: inner voice
    

3. Visual Spatial Scratchpad: keeping track of spatial information
    
4. Episodic Buffer: links information to form other parts of working memory
    

  

3. Long Term Memory: permanent storage with unlimited space
    

-can be but no guaranteed permanence

Forgetting:

1. Decay: memories degrade if unused
    
2. Inference-Based: can‚Äôt bring into STM because something is blocking it (emotion, awareness, fatigue)
    

-each time accessed changed slightly by experience/perception

-the more you access the easier to recall

Kinds of LTM:

1. Implicit (not consciously aware of, habits, procedural, CC memory responses to stimuli) v. Explicit (consciously bringing to mind)
    
2. Declarative (facts, can say) v. Non-Declarative (implicit/procedural)
    
3. Semantic (general facts) v. Episodic (personal life events)
    
4. Prospective (do in future) v. Retrospective (did in past)
    

-adrenaline makes people remember better

-more sensory avenues = better encoding

  

Priming: earlier exposure facilitates retrieval

  

Memory in Brain:

1. Hippocampus: responsible for memory (not storage but consolidation and management)
    

-severe PTSD hippocampus shrinks so unable to make new memories/learn

  

Long-Term Potentiation: receiving neuron more responsible to the next

signal that comes along, form networks/synapses

-takes time to encode and consolidate (need to stabilize in consolidation

period)

Hebb: fire together, wire together stored in specific neural pathways, new

things need a new pathway, we want to connect to what we already know

  

2. Parallel-Distributed Processing: information is represented in the brain in patterns of activation across the entire neural network simultaneously
    

  

Lecture Week 11: Memory 2

  

Physiology of Memory:

1. Neural Circuitry:
    

1. localized neural circuits (reusable brain pathways (neurogenesis) repurposed for similar events
    
2. long term potentiation (how things get put into LTM)
    

- occurs with learning

-learning causes hormonal changes, regulates neurotransmitters, impacts protein synthesis and memory consolidation

  

2. Anatomy:
    

1. Amnesia:
    

1. Anterograde: can‚Äôt form new memories, can remember past
    

-prefrontal cortex (encoding) damage

2. Retrograde: can‚Äôt recall the past, can make new memories
    

-hippocampus (consolidation) damage

2. Consolidation:
    

-have to be consolidated to be remembered (mostly in delta sleep)

  

Retrieval: using cues to remember

-if you add your own self-generated personal cues you are more likely to remember¬†

-it‚Äôs a deep (semantic) processing level to make associations

-3 associations = more likely to remember

-cues give context for further remembering

  

Retrieval: need retrieval cues

Retrieval Cues: external cues to bring stored information to the mind

Encoding Specificity Principle: cue can serve as reminder when it recreates original encoding context

State Dependent Retrieval: better recall when in same mental/emotional state

Transfer/Context-Dependent Processing: memory can transfer from one situation to another when encoding context of situations match

  
  

Eyewitness Testimony: bad and inaccurate

-traumatic things don‚Äôt encode well

-when perpetrator not in lineup people choose next best

Elizabeth Loftus:

Misinformation Effect: suggestibility by providing misleading post event information

-shows car crash video, speed estimates change based on car crash descriptors

-memory is reconstructive so is prone to suggestion¬†

  

Why We Forget:

1. Ineffective Encoding: never stored, not paying attention, not rehearsed, not consolidated
    
2. Decay: memory traces are gone, fade with time
    
3. Interference: competing information is blocking retrieval¬†
    

1. Retroactive: new information impairs retention of previously learned
    
2. Proactive: previously information interrupts new learning
    

Forgetting is Adaptive:

1. erases the painful and incongruent experiences and parts of ourselves
    
2. erases what we no longer need
    

  

Memory Lapses:

Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve: measured forgetting and retention

Retention: proportion of material retained

1. Recall: producing on your own with no cues
    
2. Recognition: picking what you‚Äôve seen from a set
    
3. Relearn: relearn previously learned information to see if retention improves the second time
    

-retention and forgetting occurs slowly over time

-we have poor retention but good recognition

  

HM: had large parts of hippocampus removed to attempt to stop severe epilepsy

-could remember everything before operation

-could not retain information beyond STM

-can remember motor skill, not facts or events

-revealed that different kinds of memory are dependent on different parts of the brain

-had motor, spatial, long-term memory but no declarative, episodic memory

Alzheimer‚Äôs: low STM, trouble making new memories

  

7 Sins of Memory:

Omission:

1. Transience: time weakens memory
    
2. Absentmindedness: preoccupied/not paying attention
    
3. Blocking: other information interferes/know but can‚Äôt bring forward
    

Commission:

1. Misattribution: assigning memory to wrong source
    
2. Suggestibility: suggestions form memory reconstruction
    
3. Bias: remember what you favour, what‚Äôs positive
    
4. Persistence: unwanted memories that you can‚Äôt forget
    

  

Lecture Week 12: Emotions

  

Emotion: interpersonal state in response to internal/external event

4 Components:

1. Physiological: changes in bodily arousal (connected to SNS and ANS)
    

-increased heart rate, temperature, respiration

2. Cognitive Feeling: subjective appraisal and interpretations of own feelings and environment
    

-evaluating our emotions, don‚Äôt know how upset we are until we respond (can have faulty appraisal)

3. Physical Behavioural: nonverbals, gestures, body language (emotions leaking into gesture)
    
4. Emotional Behavioural: keeping emotion present (happiness) or removing it (sadness)
    

-emotions have motivational force, ask to change a behaviour or respond

  

Secondary Social Sharing: intensity of event predicts how much it is shared

  

Alexithymia: personality dimension, difficulty recognizing emotions and remembering emotion-based words, don‚Äôt recognize emotional cues (social issues), comorbid with autism

  

Adaptive:

1. signal important events and direct attention
    
2. fight/flight (keep us alive)
    
3. social communication (observable information about the internal states/intentions of others, influence how others behave towards us)
    

  

-the more comfortable parents are talking about emotions the faster children develop complex emotions (requiring an ‚Äòother‚Äô like shame, guilt, empathy) and the better they can deal with emotions

  

Universality Hypothesis (Eckman): 6 basic emotions that are innate, we can all identify

-anger, disgust, happiness, fear, surprise, sadness

Evidence: blind people have facial expressions, 2 day old infants make disgust face when given lemon juice, people can judge the expressions of people in other cultures

Issues: tribe can only pick out basic emotions from one of 6, difficulty discriminating among same emotion (subtleties)

-there is agreement about some universality

Eckman: further pursued microexpressions to analyze if people are lying

-signs of emotions (expressions) are caused by internal states (that are universal) that are caused by internal/external events

  

Measuring Emotions:

1. Behavioural Display: observing behaviour and facial expressions (people can hide emotions or be interpreted wrong)
    
2. Self Reports: survey, questionnaire (inaccurate, social desirability bias)
    
3. Psychophysical Reactions: using technology to identify basic emotions
    

1. face electromyography
    
2. heart rate
    
3. skin conductance (galvanic skin response)
    
4. fMRI
    

  

Functions:

1. Cognitive:
    

1. organize and retrieve memories
    
2. prioritize concerns, needs, goals
    
3. guide judgements, help make decisions
    

3. Behavioural
    

1. emotions alter behaviours (keep doing or stop)
    
2. Action Tendencies: predictable emotional response/behaviour someone will have in specific situations (this is what knowing people is)
    

5. Social
    

1. foundation of relationships
    
2. helps improve relationship quality
    
3. helps empathy and work performance
    

-can predict relationship success by responses to others‚Äô and own emotions

  

Theories of Emotions:

1. James-Lange Theory: emotions are result of physiological changes
    

-emotion is conscious awareness of physiological responses to stimuli

stimuli > arousal > emotion (cognitive awareness/label)

2. Cannon-Bard Theory: subjective emotion and activation of SNS (bodily arousal) occur simultaneously
    

-conscious experience is simultaneous with physiological response, cognitive components influence interpretation

stimuli > arousal

> emotion

3. Schater and Singer Two-Factor Theory: emotional state is cognitive appraisal of physiological state
    

-emotions do not exist until we label them, all emotions are a cognitive assessment of the same feeling, we may mislabel them

stimuli > arousal > label > emotion

  

Physiology of Emotions: emotions elicit different physiological responses

  

1. Discrete Emotion Theory: every emotion has a specific, unique physiological response (read off that response to identify the emotion)
    

Issue: similar responses to different emotions

  

2. Cognitive-Mediational Theory: cognitive interpretations/subjective appraisal are key to experiences of emotion
    

Richard Lazarus: cognitive appraisal is mediator between environmental stimuli and reactions

Appraisal: how you choose to see a situation

-can appraise an event different ways/have different physiological responses

  

4. Evolutionary Theory (Ekman): emotions are innate, passed through generations because necessary for survival

Basic Emotions: groups of emotions innate across cultures

  

Emotional Development: basic responses are innate, get refined over time

1. Basic Emotions: interest, disgust, distress, contentment
    
2. Base 6: develop between 2-7 months
    
3. Complex Emotions/Secondary Emotions: guilt, shame, embarrassment, empathy, develop from 3-7 years (need a sense of self and be able to perspective take)
    

-no emotions until 6 mo or so (sensation not perception)

  

Emotions and Social Behaviour:

1. Emotional display rules: when it‚Äôs appropriate to express or suppress emotions, takes time to master (learned)
    
2. Emotional self-regulation: harder for boys, advanced language leads to better regulation and display rules
    

Pragmatics: what to say and how to say it

Receptive Speech: speaking according to display rules

  

5. Facial Feedback Theory: subjective experience of emotion is influenced by facial expressions

Duchenne Smile: with eyes, real and genuine

  

Emotions in Brain: no single structure but activation of circuitry between structures and conscious experience of emotion

1. Amygdala: threat detector
    

Appraisal System: to detect if there is a threat

Ledous:

1. Fast: thalamus > amygdala (automatic)
    
2. Slow: thalamus > cortex > amygdala (conscious thought)
    

  

Detecting Emotions in Others:

Expressive Behaviours: read in face and eyes

-introverts better at reading, extroverts easier to read

-primed to quickly detect negative emotions/words (especially if abused)

-context cues of body language changes face perception

  

Deceptive Expression: 4 observable features determine if sincere/insincere

1. Morphology: expressive muscles (Duchenne smile, spontaneous, crinkle eyes)
    
2. Symmetry: sincere = symmetrical
    
3. Duration: sincere = fast
    
4. Temporal Patterning: appear/disappear smoothly
    

  

Detecting Lying (Ekman):

-polygraphs not useful

-slow talking, less eye blinks, less facial movement

-we are predisposed to believe others are sincere

  

Positive Psychology: study of enrichment of positive feelings, traits, abilities and virtues

-can develop these things

-starting from what‚Äôs good and improving that

Happy people are: optimistic, outgoing, curious, tender-minded, high SE, spiritual, goal-directed, have a sense of control over their lives
