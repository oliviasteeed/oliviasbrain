## Notes

Terms:

Symbolic Interactionism:

-term interaction starts being used by sociologists to describe communication between people¬†

Stimulus-Response Theory:

-interaction also used to describe physiological reactions of sensory organs/muscle groups in body)

Cybernetic Theory:

-interaction is extended to include human-machine communication.

-different forms of feedback

-to make machines like humans must be: capable of learning and have reflective reactions

Interactive Art:

Kwastec: art requiring audience participation without digital mediation

Huhtamo: participant is completing the work

Ars Electronica: publicly installed, interaction (passive allowed), real-time interaction not mandatory, doesn‚Äôt have to be digitally mediated

Ideologically Oriented Interactive Art:

-work focuses more on getting an idea across than the technology it uses to convey idea

Technologically Oriented Interactive Art:

-primary goal of artwork is to showcase new technology

Open Systems:

-not a set system, audience/participant has capacity to change the outcome/results of the experience/artwork (collaborative and interactive)

Closed Systems:

-audience only has one (or limited) option for interaction, they cannot change the experience or outcome, the experience is set (usually for profit)

  

Strategies/Categories of Interaction:

  

Kwastec Categories/Influential Concepts for Interactive Art:

1. Process and Chance
    

-to show absence of intentionality, to enhance spontaneity, to experience/be open to unpredictability of process beyond control of artist

2. Participation
    

-to enhance self-perception of performers in work, seek active involvement from public, elicit scripted responses from public, promote and negotiate relationships between recipients and artist

3. Material of Everyday Life
    

-to challenge concept of art/artist, to create and play with new aesthetics

4. Rules and Game Structures
    

-control audience participation via handouts/scripts, event scores, game strategies to specify goal

5. Movement and Perception
    

-encourage audience participation, involve viewer intellectually, physically, emotionally, feedback through questionnaires/surveys

6. Self Perception and Self Observation
    

-confront viewer with own reactions, involve viewer as performer and observer, use time lags to separate audience from self

7. From Cybernetics to Artificial Reality
    

-machines that can respond to environmental stimuli, different levels of interaction based on audience participation

8. Artificial Intelligence and Artificial Life
    

-criticize technology/ models of robot-controlled society, explore potentials of systems, imitate and represent natural processes of evolution

9. Collaborative Networks and Telepresence
    

-use communication networks as new for of collaboration, alternative distribution and exchange, explore telepresence (shared virtual space), as means of remote control, as new aesthetic

10. Virtual Reality
    

-create alternate realities/distance from life, reclaim illusion as central aspect of art, create new ways of engaging with reality through illusion/immersion

11. Alinearity
    

-opportunities to alter plot, organization, ending, enhance/intensify sense of immersion, offer multiple ways of engaging/ different types of cross-linking information

12. Art, Technology, Society
    

-responds to connection and interplay between, institutional and military influence of technology development, potential uses of interactive systems outside art world, criticize use of technology in everyday life

  

Huhtamo: What is Interactive Art?

Interactive Art: result of human-machine relationship dating back to industrial revolution

-artist/audience boundary is dissolved, audience completes work

Ars Electronica (post 2004) definition of Interactive Art:

-does not require digital mediation

-passive interaction (contemplation) allowed

-does not require real-time interaction¬†

  

Daniels Strategies of Interactivity:

1. Interaction with Video Story Through Multiple Options
    

-anything with a choice between non-interactive components

2. Interaction with Closed Data World Through Which Viewer can Navigate
    

-static system viewer can explore but not change

3. Interaction Through Body Interfaces
    

-anything using non-standard immersive physical experience

4. Data Structures Subject to Dynamic Self-Development and Influenced by Interaction
    

-AI programming techniques allow system to change in response to user input, computer has creative agency

5. Dialogue-Based Models
    

-dialogue between people through a medium

6. Exemplary Viewer
    

-one audience member becomes performer in piece, other audience members watch

7. Collective Structures in Media Realm
    

-many people participate in a work through digital means

  

Kluszczynski Strategies of Interaction:

Strategies: techniques artists use to control audience experience

Tactics: behaviour of audience in response to tactics

1. Instrument
    

-organized around interface that audience creates performance with

2. Game
    

-differs from game as: critiques media, user is aware of game structure as art

-stands for something/critiques something

3. Archives
    

-nonlinear information gathered and organized for audience

Database: basic feature of interactive art, contains nonlinear data for user to access

4. Labyrinth
    

-hypertext organization (multidirectional navigation within structure)

-closed shape

5. Rhizome
    

-cybertext organization (multidirectional, unpredictable development)

-open system

-can be converted from interactions, undergo transformations while keeping memory of original, be permanently changed

6. Systems
    

-interaction of two systems, no audience interaction

7. Network
    

-creates relationships between participants

8. Spectacle
    

-participant witnesses an event they have little control/influence over
