Container: context of message, impacts expectations, layered

1. formality
    
2. address/greeting
    
3. urgency
    
4. expectation
    
5. generational difference
    
6. where seen (phone v. laptop)
    
7. cultural context
    
8.   
    

Speaker: who is sending the message

  

Audience:

1. Primary Audience: who message is intended for
    
2. Secondary Audience: people who have access to message
    

  

Message: what is being conveyed

  

Speaker + Audience = Relationship:

1. who has the power?
    
2. group differences/similarities (different ‚Äúlanguages‚Äù)
    

1. age
    
2. gender
    
3. education
    
4. income
    
5. culture
    
6. ethnicity
    

3. level of familiarity
    

  

Audience + Message = Knowledge:

1. information needed to understand message (expertise)
    
2. strategies of conveyance (depends on audience)
    

1. examples
    
2. language
    

  

Speaker + Message = Purpose:

-always to persuade

-inform

-educate

-entertain

-goodwill

  

Native Advertising: ads that emulate other media

  

Goal of Communication Design: (O‚ÄôGrady, The Information Design Handbook)

1. Clear
    
2. Accessible
    
3. Easy to Understand
    

  

Goal of Scientific Writing: (Sharples, Writing as Design)

-conveying facts to intended audience to promote understanding

  

Writing as Design Practice: (Spector, Damrin, How Architects Write)

1. Subject Matter Knowledge
    
2. Rhetorical Knowledge
    
3. Writing Process Knowledge
    
4. Genre Knowledge
    

1. Internal Discourse Community: speak same language, same discipline, specific language
    
2. External Discourse Community: lack of familiarity, general language
    

-proof of all types of knowledge = trustworthy appeal to audience

  

Readings Week 1:

  

How Architects Write (Tom Spector & Rebecca Damron, p. 1-14):

-clarity is goal, obtained through

1. Subject Matter Knowledge (expertise):
    

-history, technology, context of a field

-must assimilate information in able to synthesize

2. Rhetorical Knowledge:
    

-ability to argue/persuade to convey intended meaning

3. Writing Process Knowledge:
    

-procedural knowledge to complete writing task including grammar and mechanics

4. Genre Knowledge:
    

-understanding demands and expectations of chosen genre

1. Internal Discourse Community: experts like you
    

-other specialists

-specific language

Goal: improve and redefine discipline

2. External Discourse Community: laypeople
    

-external, peripheral people who are not specialists

-general language

Goal: convince/inform for effective collaboration¬†

  

Beautiful Users: Designing for People (Ellen Lupton):

-design should always meet people‚Äôs needs

  

Users: represented many ways by designers (normative body types, diverse sizes and abilities, consumers to observe/target, collaborators in problem solving)

  

User-Centered Design: start with user consideration, enhance lives with new solutions

-usability over aesthetics

Telephone Design Example (Dreyfuss):

1. bridging technology/human gap with sculptural aesthetic focus
    
2. addressed usability problems to improve experience by studying users
    
3. created different designs to target niche markets, making a consumer product
    

  

Human Factors / Human Engineering (Dreyfuss): fitting machine to person rather than person to machine

Ergonomics: combine understanding of human dimensions and psychology

  

Measure of Man Charts (Dreyfuss): creating principles of height/size based on 50th percentile (mean) to use in design

-built on international standards movement in 1910s to improve efficiency in design (not enhance comfort)

  

Anthropometrics: measuring human movement and anatomy, key component of Taylorization

Taylorization: maximizing factory worker productivity with time and motion studies

  

Neufert: Bauhaus student, embraced global standards by coordinating object/room/building measurements with typical bodies

Octametric Brick: unit of measurement based on human dimensions, basis of grid used to generate dimensions for any building

-sought to make body conform to norms, not norms conform to body

  

Leonardo Da Vinci: the man is the measure

Vitruvius: buildings/cities should be made using units derived from the body to create ideal environments for human habitation/locomotion

  

Diffrient: created Humanscale series of rotary selectors with wheel at pivot points, creating interactive tools for user-centered design

-account for differences within 95 percentiles in height (not weight)

  

Universal Design Movement (late 60s/early 70s): vocal disability community wants a world designed to accommodate diverse bodies

  

McCarthy: disabled by objects in environment, not self

-involve user in design process

-do not focus on what user can‚Äôt do, encourages dependency, but empower to live independently

-people use and enjoy assistive products when they are convenient and beautiful

  

Williamson: putting universal design disability features into mass market products is disability erasure¬†

  

-as people embrace technology as life-enhancing, they want it hidden less

  

Interface Design: designing connection between human and machine¬†

-Dreyfuss office pioneered by focusing on friction

-controls invite interactions with complex, hidden systems, model how machine works and limit people‚Äôs actions with it

  

Interaction Design: addressing point of contact between people and devices as devices increase in complexity

Laurel: ways for machines and humans to construct actions together

Moggridge: pioneer of interaction design, designed first laptop, co founded IDEO

Design Thinking: methodology disseminated by IDEO design firm

  

Experience Design: shaping experiences by scripting narratives around person/product interactions

  

Affordance: object‚Äôs capacity to support action

-triggers intuitive response

-can be learned/unlearned culturally

-exist in relationship to agents (can become obstacles/limitations as abilities change)

-objects and their affordances belong to larger systems (do not work in isolation)

  

Open Source Design: subverting interface design (masking complexity) by exposing mechanism behind interface

Hackers/Makers: customizing/changing/reassembling products to fit their specific needs

Do-It-Yourself Culture: no longer dependent on designers to map needs

-empowers understanding of technology/constraints/problem solving

  

Moggridge: the future of designing interactions is more holistic

Ecology: interdependence of living

Cultural Anthropology: understanding the human condition

Cognitive Psychology: how the mind works

Physiology: how the body works

Anthropometrics: dimensions of human anatomy

  

How We Write: Writing as Creative Design (Mike Sharples):

Chapter 10: Messages in Bottles and Cultures:

  

Message: conceptual link between different minds

-closer time/culture between author and reader = more understanding

-message is unfixed, formed by comparative cultures of author and reader

-message isn‚Äôt text but context of use

  

Dialogue Between Reader and Writer:

1. Dialogue Directly with Reader:
    

John Ruskin: goal of writing is looking for and sharing truth

-artist reveals truths to reader because they see world differently

-this implies there is no one correct way to see the world

Bakhtin: goal of objective writing is communicating understanding, not telling ‚Äútruth‚Äù

-distinguished natural sciences and human sciences

Natural Sciences: subject observes/gains knowledge of mute object

Human Sciences: discourse where data are texts created by subjects

-writing is impacted by life experiences, culture, context, immediate resources and cultural values and influences

Subject: active agents

-textbooks are subjects because created by human mind, not neutral

-E = mc2 relationship is object, formula is subject, text changed by cultural

meaning

Texts: thoughts, speech, gestures, actions of agents

-interpreted subjectively in attempt to understand others

-can only gain understanding by engaging in dialogue

  

2. Dialogue with Imagined Reader:
    

-writer actively anticipating response of reader and making adjustments (bridging cultural gaps, omitting the obvious)

-includes use of thesaurus and style guide (standing for readers, helps to fit context of readers)

-avoid conscious dialogue through ideology

Ideology: social/cultural assumptions influencing action and understanding

-natural to you, strange/annoying/threatening to others

-difficult to take on another ideology/write with a different voice

-can only understand others though their signs that we interpret through our own biases

  

3. Dialogue with Society/Culture:
    

-moulded by/moulds social environment

Conceptual Spaces: social constructs formed by ideology, context, interactions

-mapping is part of creativity/engaging with society

-ideologies revealed in words and the meanings we give them (meanings can change)

-words are never neutral¬†

-written text ‚Äúdies‚Äù at publication, becomes fixed but society continues to progress creating a gap that changes the meanings (cannot know what original author meant)

  

Post-Structuralism: writing no longer conveys universal truths

-reader can interpret texts differently depending on context/time¬†

-meaning formed by cultural expectations (easy = conforms, difficult = subverts)

  

Genre: set of expectations codified by society into categories

-unstable if meaning is unstable

-means denying other elements

-culturally determined so forever changing

  

Reconciling subjectivity with past events (writers don‚Äôt describe society, they invent it):

-using past events/multiple accounts to find truth

-writers don‚Äôt set out to corrupt readers‚Äô minds

-we are bound to things other than perbsonal ideology (professional standards)

  

Writing Principles (social constraints):

-do not present unwarranted belief as fact

-provide justification for assertions

-reference sources of ideas

-do not selectively ignore facts

-acknowledge limitations of arguments

-present text in a form to assist, not mislead the reader

  

-subversion should be intentional and serve a purpose, otherwise it‚Äôs just ignorance

  

7 Things Every Designer Needs to Know About Writing (Ellen Lupton):

1. Ask Questions
    
2. Read
    
3. Writing Has a Body (writing needs graphic design)
    
4. Most Writing is Technical (needs clarity)
    
5. Writing Seeks a Reader (imagine reader, who‚Äôs reading this and why do they care?)
    
6. Try to Write at an 8th Grade Level (average reading level in US)
    

1. short sentences
    
2. short words
    
3. avoid adverbs (strong verb doesn‚Äôt need help)
    
4. avoid passive voice (no actor)
    

  

Paraphrasing Writing Video: good writing comes from good reading

Visual Literacy: ability to interpret meaning from visuals

Critical Reading: ability to interpret text/meanings using analytical tools to understand and convey information

Critical Writing: convey writers‚Äô understanding of context and discourse (content)

Writing Intelligence: ability to design/deliver message to effectively persuade and inform

Writing: vehicle of thinking

  

Summary: synthesized ideas articulating main points in shorter form than original, maintains accuracy and intention of original

Paraphrase: point written in own words in similar or longer form than original, maintains accuracy and intention of original

  

I Say: why did I use this information?¬†

  

Finding Topics with an Issue for Effective Persuasive Writing:¬†

-to make them agree with your POV

1. Topic: general subject
    
2. Issue: important problem debated by many stakeholders
    

Research Questions:

1. who are the stakeholders? how many are strongly affected?
    
2. what is debate between different stakeholders?
    
3. who has written about it? are there enough resources about it?
    
4. could you begin making recommendations?
    

Areas of Issue:

1. ethics
    
2. disciplinary
    
3. identity
    
4. legality
    
5. technology
    
6. education
    

3. Stance: your POV on issue
    
4. Argument: point given to persuade others of stance
    
5. Counter-Argument: point to oppose ideas of other argument
    
6. Recommendations: persuade to start solving problem based on your POV
    

  

Lecture Wk 2: Reading, Writing, Knowing

  

Fact: something verifiable, statistic or number

Inference: objective conclusion reached based on fact¬†

Interpretation: subjective inference reached based on personal experiences

Opinion: judgment based on facts, can test validity/alignment with facts

Belief: based on personal values/morals and not facts, not testable or verifiable

  

3 Forms of Dialogue:

1. reader to writer: reader‚Äôs direct response to text (reader resistance or persuasion?)
    
2. internal: writer anticipating readers‚Äô responses (will they understand?)
    
3. writer to society: communication within larger cultural context (does content suit expectations of discourse community?)
    

Genres: have conventions: expectations for language, form, style, content

  

Rhetoric: tools of persuasion

1. Ethos: appeal to character, credibility, reliability
    

1. cite sources
    
2. address limitations of arguments
    

2. Logos: appeal to logic
    

1. make sure reader understands issues
    
2. stats
    
3. examples as evidence (not anecdotal)
    

Evidence: stats, studies, interview, example, anecdotal (don‚Äôt use this)

3. Pathos: appeal to feelings, values, beliefs (makes it feel important)
    

1. interviews/1st hand accounts of people directly affected
    
2. personal narrative (why you care)
    

  

Paraphrase Workshop:

According to professional designer Ellen Lupton (2014), design does not always begin with the end users in mind. Other considerations like cultural conventions and budgetary constraints can impede the designer‚Äôs aspirations. Unfortunately, product design can be informed more by ease of manufacturing and existing standards than intentional choices of a designer. (p.21)

  

Readings Week 2:

  

Research Process:

1. choose broad topic (with debate within and resources on)
    
2. narrow topic
    
3. draft preliminary thesis (to guide research)
    
4. use library to locate sources
    
5. compile a working bibliography (list of potentially useful sources)
    
6. evaluate sources (recent, factual, credible, scholarly, useful?)
    
7. take notes (paraphrase, quote, summary, personal notes)
    

  

Writing Process:

1. outline (read over notes, look for patterns, synthesize)
    
2. write first draft
    
3. revise and edit¬†
    

1. considers audience?
    
2. writing purpose?
    
3. thesis proven?
    
4. transitions smooth?
    
5. spelling and grammar?
    

  

Reading Week 3:

  

Evaluating Sources: The 3 R‚Äôs:

1. Recency (within last 5 years)
    
2. Relevance (is it actually about your topic?)
    
3. Reliability (author/expertise? purpose? peer review?)
    

  

Lecture Week 3:

Issue: problem debated by stakeholders

1. debatable current issue
    
2. identify and research stakeholders
    
3. illustrate historic/cultural context
    
4. convey voices of most relevant stakeholders/experts
    
5. take a stance
    
6. logically connect stance to voices of experts
    

  

Stance: X is a problem because Y because Z, therefore A should do B

  

Lecture Week 4: Establishing a Persuasive Ethos

  

Rhetorical Approaches:

  

Aristotle: 3 characteristics of effective communication

1. good reasoning (logical)¬†
    
2. good character (trustworthy)
    
3. good will (respectful)¬†
    

-tone/language of writing

  

Mike Sharples: messages in bottles

-reader understands text/author by negotiating similarities between their cultures

-meaning is the context (container)

-when we speak/write we are engaged in situated dialogue

  

Spector Damrin: strategies change based on discourse community

-internal discourse: specific language

-external discourse: lay language

  

Bakhtin: 3 forms of dialogue:

1. reader‚Äôs response to text
    
2. writer‚Äôs internal dialogue to anticipate reader response (providing definitions, explaining content for understanding)
    
3. dialogue between writer and society (culture, discourse community, communicating to wider than primary audience)
    

  

Tools for Persuasion:

  

1. Ethos (speaker): appeal to character, credibility, trust
    

-language, tone, respectful, not trying to deceive or confuse

-cite, be clear

  

2. Pathos (audience): appeal to emotions
    

-emotional connection, examples, effective use of language

-overly emotional may backfire (balance fact and emotion), just enough to understand why you care

  

3. Logos (message): appeal to logic, information and how it is presented
    

-statistics, evidence, examples

-evidence is clear and understandable to audience

  

Beason: 3 categories of writers

1. writer as writer (not a professional writer but job includes writing)
    
2. writer as business person (other traits aside from writing skill important)
    
3. writer as representative (individual representing organization)
    

  

hasty writer: did not take time to proofread

careless writer: neglectful, not due to lack of time (worse for ethos)

uncaring writer:

uninformed writer:

  

Cockcroft and Cockcroft:

Ethos: set of values held by speaker/writer reflected in language, social attitudes and behaviour

1. Personality: characteristics of speaker that distinguish them as individual
    
2. Stance: position on issue
    

Situated Ethos: the way others see you, can‚Äôt really control (education, career, gender, social position, culture, race)

Invented Ethos: the way we want others to view our character, can control (language, mannerism, things we consciously do to be perceived as trustworthy and credible)

  

Readings Week 4:

  

Persuading People: Cockroft & Cockroft

Introduction: Rhetoric

Rhetoric: art of persuasive discourse

-identification and appeal (has motive), controlled interaction

Discourse: series of continuous communication

Discourse Analysis: structural analysis of spoken/written language

Functional Persuasion: persuasive discourse concerned with everyday life

Literary Persuasion: prose/poetry persuading us of imaginary truth/emotional significance of their discourse

  

Chapter 1: Ethos

Ethos: set of values held by speaker/writer reflected in language, social attitudes and behaviour

3. Personality: links persuader‚Äôs identity to act of persuasion
    
4. Stance: reflects group values but subject to persuader‚Äôs control
    

Positive Rhetoric: reveals value of persuader‚Äôs stance, shifts/broadens in response to audience

Negative Rhetoric: hides value, persuades from single viewpoint

-hide self-benefit, exaggerate benefit of audience

-changing of attitudes is heart of persuasion, comes from identification with persuader

Ideational Function: using language directly related to audience experience

Interpersonal Function: linking audience and persuader

Textual Cohesion: coherence of text
