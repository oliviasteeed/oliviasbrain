## Notes

Week 1: Technology and Society

  

Keywords: body of theories allowing us to think critically about how everything we do is mediated and mediation transforms sense of self and world view

  

Media:

-plural of medium (the middle)

-means through which any message communicated by

-channels of communication

-not neutral

  

Media Studies:

-thinking critically about media

  

Introduction:

Laurie Ouellette and Jonathan Gray:

Raymond Williams‚Äô Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society:

-words to interrogate issues of media, culture, society

Media: communication and mediation

  

-20th century mass media changed meaning of term ‚Äúmedia‚Äù

-media is forms, sign systems, acts on physical body¬†

-defined by media before what it actually is

Mediation: modern use of mass media to spread ideologies and distort reality

Communication: to make common to many/impart an action

  

STS: science and technology as socially mediated and constructed

  

Society:

-economically interdependent group sharing a culture, reside in specific geographic region

-affect/affected by activities of individuals¬†

Emile Durkheim: dependent on sharing essential ideas (time, space, cause, number)

Science:

-social institution attempting to explain the world without paranormal/supernatural/transcendental causes (scientific method)

-understood as primary source of knowledge in Western societies

-reduces other knowledge to craft

-other cultures have other ways of developing/transmitting valid knowledge, not organized in a way Western cultures recognize or approve

-all societies produce knowledge, systems of belief, ideas and systems of practice that implement that knowledge

  

Social Science:

-have not mastered social science like physical science

Goal: improved sociological literacy

technological literacy: ability to consume/use technology

Science Wars: natural science versus social science

Language Game: combining language sets to create expansive critical perspective

Social: humanity is social

  

Technology:

-summation of artifact, process, knowledge gained from experience

Stephen Unger: intelligent organization and manipulation of materials for useful purposes

-what we make and what we do

Rebecca Solnit: practice, technique, device for altering world/experience of world

  

Technoscience:

-interactions of science and technology

-context of technology and science within culture (not separate from social world), purity of science comes from removing social world (erasing workers, hiding discrimination)

Donna Haraway: condensation of knowledge and power

Bruno Latour (coined term): messiness and ambiguity within socially constructed claims of science

Technosocial: mutual interpretation of technology and society and its effects on social lives/relationships

1. science and technology are social institutions
    
2. science and technology affect and are affected by distribution of societal resources
    
3. to understand science and technology we need tools of historical/anthropological study
    

Technological Determinism: technological change is inevitable, always positive

-for science and technology to make the world better they must become socially coherent

-reducing world to certainty is impossible

-cult of science replacing religion

  

Week 2: Feminism

  

STS:

Fact:¬†

-idea or concept that everyone (or community/network) believe as true

-created by communities, not immune to history and society

Social Construction:

Culture: totality of groups‚Äô way of living, knowing, believing

Society: how cultural group organizes themself, cultural explanation for social order

Super-Culture/Third Culture/Lateralization: cultures unbounded by geography (professional not geographic boundaries)

Worldviews: way of interpreting the world based on cultural perspective, allows us to classify/categorize world

-uses binaries (good/bad, male/female, young/old)

-exaggerating differences creates semblance of order

Humanistic: acknowledge emotion/action of humans creating science

Constructivism: minutiae of day-to-day science and how it proliferates

Relativism: arbiters of science are grounded in historical/cultural/intellectual position

- affirm/critique social construction

Realism: nature exists outside humans, thus it is objective

Social Construction: applying methods/theories of science to science

  

Feminism:

-debates if sex differences are socially or biologically grounded, equity and equality issues

Donna Haraway: feminist goals are to create science not based on domination, rejects claims for pure objectivity, recognized other logics

  

Scientific Sexism:

-prejudice embedded within unconscious bias (more male animal biology, genital research)

-theories based on stereotypes

-constructed under binary worldview

  

Feminism and Science:

-science can‚Äôt can‚Äôt cope with individual differences because it doesn't fit into universalism worldview¬†

-feminism broaden exploratrions of science (language), question objectivity¬†

-women skills not called science

Feminist Sciences:

1. feminist values
    
2. interplay of principles
    
3. more self-reflection
    
4. using outsiders as equally valid knowledge sources¬†
    
5. not based on domination¬†
    
6. rejects pure objectivity
    
7. considers other logics
    

-binary worldview, biological sex corresponds with intelligence and sexual behaviours

-masculine bias in evolutionary, endocrinological studies of behavioural sex differences -most blatant in human science, trying to justify sexism with ‚Äúscientific differences‚Äù

-science is shaped by who does it, pays for it, who is asking questions

-people in power decide what knowledge is created

  

Intersectionality: many forms of overlapping opression/discrimination

Bell Hooks: feminist social theory is not immune to universalizing, silencing, marginalizing¬†

  

Racism:

Scientific Racism:

Craniometry: measuring skull size to deduce brain size, assuming brain size corresponds to intelligence

AI: biases of race are programed in

Kate Crawford: classification in AI reveals that gender, race, sexuality are falsely assumed to be natural, fixed, detectable categories (no scientific backing for this)

  

Keywords:

  

Feminism:

-transformed analysis of entertainment, news, media effects/structures/practices

-society structured through domination of men over women

  

Laura Mulvey:

Male Gaze (1975):

-depiction of women through perspective of heterosexual cis male

-sexual object to be looked at, passive, for male pleasure

-surveilled and self-surveilling/objectifying¬†

  

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
||Characters||
||The Male Gaze||
|Camera Person/Director||Audience|

  

Susan J. Douglas:¬†

-women are sexual spectacles, men advance the plot

-dismissing girl media as silly ignores socialization into femininity

-women can interpret sexist texts in empowering ways

-women embody conflicting views

Enlightened Sexism: feminism has been achieved, not it‚Äôs okay to resume use of sexist stereotypes¬†

Hegemony: beliefs/values benefiting elites become accepted by non-elites

Post Feminism: belief that equality is acheieved and feminism is now useless

Neoliberalism: market not government distributes goods/services

  

Week 3: Race, Power and Representation

  

STS:

Technology in Motion:

Technological Diffusion: process of new technology becoming widely used

Innovation: invention that becomes integrated in society (solves problems/meets needs)

Multiples: inventions appearing in more than one place at a time

-what innovation wins depends on context, preferences, power

Problem of Inventor:

1. problem to solve
    
2. audience to address
    

Closure: all groups working to define technology (come to agreement on what it is)

Standardization: agreement on specifics/features of new technology, usually through monopoly

-not always the best technology wins (cultural ideals, economic relations, social power relations also influential)

Pre-Scientific:

Theory:

Goal: grasp significant truths about the world

Theory of Knowledge: analyzes, synthesizes, evolves

-invoke theory to organize world

-explains unfamiliar and makes it familiar

Western: impersonal idiom

-explain unfamiliar with objectivity and distance for authority

-makes it impossible to examine in a social context

-uses theory to impose/declare superiority

Traditional: personal idiom

-depends on speaker/community for knowledge/authority

-not questioned like Western science because sacred

Posthumanism: attempt to make material/symbolic actions of humans open to inquiry without referring to foundational categories

-not everyone is on the same path in the same context

Mentality:

-caused by/identical to brain processes

-determined by cultural context

Cognitive Science: mind is set of mental representations

cognition = consciousness = social phenomenon

West: emotions associated with heat, mentalities with brain (since ancient Greek)

Physician/neuroscience: mentalities are in our heads

Sociological: mentalities are byproducts of social interactions

-unconscious power of social life on mentalities

-upbringing (socialization) puts up filters to control thoughts, behaviours¬†

Brain: dependent on culture to operate

-cognition cannot be decontextualized from cultural/social context

-mind is a cultural invention

Manuel Castells: power as complex networks

1. Programming Power: power to build
    
2. Switching Power: connecting to other sources of power
    

Media and Power: ability to influence basic reference points of social life

-colonization of social imagination and entertainment

Nick Couldry:¬†

-power to and power over

2. Economic Power: power needed to invest in design, production, maintaining of symbolic forms
    
3. Social Power: power needed to focus attention on specific content over any other
    
4. Political Power: power to block or directly censor symbolic content
    

-makes a difference in our lives¬†

  

Representation:

Lisa Henderson:

Political: elected representatives

Symbolic: standing for in media

-something standing for something else

-achievement of language

-reality unavailable except through symbols

-change in platform = change in representation

-based on who people want to watch, who advertisers support, who deserves to be seen

-inclusion strongest when inner group differences are represented

-world as we know it, feel it, like it to be

Empirical Realism: representation that resembles reality

Emotional Realism: representation that connects to one‚Äôs feeling of reality

Symbolic Annihilation: exclusion or erasure through underrepresentation/use of stereotypes

  

Race:

Herman Gray:

-arbitrary physical differences assumed to imply intelligence/capacity/creativity differences

-celebrated and discriminated in different contexts

-marketable distinctions organized around ethnic difference (marked as cultural distinctions) that drive access and representation in media

-separate but equal racial model

-legal, social, cultural invention

-race is exercise of power over groups for resource control

Racial Projects: cultural value, social classification and scientific explanation, judicial legitimation¬†

-operate through feelings, emotions the body

-emphasize truth of race

  

Week 6: Data, Surveillance, Anatomy of AI

  

Artificial Intelligence:¬†

Kate Crawford: not artificial or intelligent, embodied materials and labour

-not autonomous, rational, able to discern anything without extensive training from large datasets

-depends on political and social structures

  

Anatomy of AI:

Kate Crawford and Vladan Joler:

-complexity of devices is hidden (scale much less convenient than just flipping a light switch but hidden so appears so)

-alexa learns with each interaction

-3 central processes to run large scale AI system: material resources, human labour, data

-metaphor of ‚Äúthe cloud‚Äù removes physical reality of resource extraction and labour involved

-AI systems different from other consumer technology because they rely on human (user) data (help to train, add voice/questions to datasets, you are product too)

-anything beyond prescribed user interaction is beyond user control

-hide how system works to make process abstract

-media usually thought of as extension of human senses, abstracts technological/geological processes and natural elements from which it is built (depletion of resources)

Digital Labour: work of maintaining and building digital systems, deeply embodied, creates new accumulation of wealth and power concentrated in very thin social layer

-the physicality behind immaterial cloud

-hiding labour/inhumane working conditions

-only see product not process

-very complex chain of supply, hard for company to know let alone consumers

-completely nontransparent about practices, energy used, impact (we are always being tracked, they refuse to be)

Invisible Labour: outsourced labour hidden behind interfaces, being forced to train image recognition AI for free (recaptcha)

-contemporary technology is rooted in/runs on exploitation of human bodies

Power: democratization of AI is false, training requires large datasets that only those in power have access to, we have to train AI for free

-systems are trained with biased datasets, repopulating technology with bigotry under the guise of science

Affinity to Infinity: we want to understand/categorize everything

-every form of biodata is being captured and logged into databases for AI training

-nothing can be common anymore, extreme ownership for a capitalist society

  

Data: any type of information

-data is not inherently good or bad, its how it‚Äôs used that can be damaging

Melissa Gregg and Dawn Nafus:

-major role in power relations in society

-smartphones extract data from everyday experiences that can be bought/sold/used for political claim making

-started in science: compounding data to understand social/population behaviour of organisms

-no longer required human agent of analysis (big data), large amounts evaluated by machines

-data has different function/meaning depending on context, rarely fixed

Qualities of Data:

1. collected insights (tension between truth and persuasion)
    
2. always have a date
    
3. gain significance through association
    
4. potential is to facilitate narrative
    
5. may/may not point to culturally stable references
    
6. neither qualitative nor quantitative
    

Collected and used in three ways:

1. Self-assembled information about individuals where data capture is self-nominated and people create their own narrative
    

The Quantified Self: gathering data to gain awareness of different parts of self

(health trackers)

-prepare us for exploration of body, mind, senses that works in between observation

-shows hidden life not always available to conscious eye

2. Information about others captured/assembled by third parties to serve their purpose¬†
    

-control with data, with or without consent

-justification: convenience (google maps), safety (airport security)

3. Community-oriented and purposive
    

-bring attention to cause or issue (police murders, smartphone as protection)

-normalizing technological oversight of technical and leisure activity

-data collected with intention to produce actionable insights, knowledge that prompts a response

Big Data Divide (Mark Andrejevic): individuals have little chance to influence terms on which their data is gathered and used, power asymmetry is cause for concern

Foucault: modern institutions rendered activities visible by catching them in discourse, naming, categorizing

Data Sweat: leaking information

  

Surveillance:

Kelly Gates:

-efforts to govern or control activities of others under observation, signifies power relationship (rules and punishment)

-watching over, controlling

-prevents, encourages manipulates actions of others (targeted ads, obeying law)

Panopticon Prison Design (Jeremy Bentham): designed so only a few guards can watch all inmates at once, they don‚Äôt know if being watched but know it‚Äôs possible

Focault: panopticon a metaphor for how surveillance is designed in society

-surveillance is covert, maybe being watched so always act in accordance

-design to control so don‚Äôt need force

-all modern spaces designed to induce vigilance/visibility of individuals (physical and virtual)

-state (depends on contracted private), private, labour management, consumer research

-analyzing emotions, actions

-so big nobody understands scope

-surveillance exists within art, media, entertainment (will to submission)

-predicting/controlling the future (foresee, prepare, control)

  

Week 7: Cyborgs, Humans and Technology

  

Keywords (Jennifer Slack):¬†

Technology:

-story of technology often about advancement, progress, making things better

Cultural Truths about Technology:

1. Synonymous with progress
    
2. Result of scientific or industrial progress
    

Meanings of Technology:

1. Disclosing of Order (principle for conceiving)
    
2. Transformational Processes (process of creation/technoscience)
    
3. Embodiment of Knowledge (social/political values that object reinforces/produces)
    
4. Kind of Object (a technological tool)
    

-don‚Äôt always know full story of technology, is narrative based in truth?

  

STS

Technology and Society:

Technological Determinism: technology leads to social progres, technological progress is positive

Technological Fix: technology can fix any problem

Social Determinism: society leads technological progress and reflects existing power structures

Winner: technology is not neutral or autonomous, it reinforces social beliefs and power structures

Latour: Actor Network Theory (open to ways we understand technology and many actors and motives involved in construction)

Woolgar: how stories are created about technology

  

Cyborg: cybernetic organism  
-communication between biology and machine are seamless, replicate or improve human ability

(original motivation was to remake human body for space survival)

  

Cyborg Art: creating new senses/feelings with technological organ implants, inspired by nature, animals already have these senses

-opportunity for self-invention, empathize more with animals/world

-could be exclusionary, only available to elites

  

Donna Haraway: Cyborg Manifesto:¬†

-we are already cyborgs that integrate mechanical artifacts and biological human action into identity and society

-incorporating technology into liberation (not praising or demonizing)¬†

-question unevenness of who benefits from cyborg technology

-rejects Winner determinism, technology and society do not have to have cause and effect, they are one. We are so integrated we can change narratives.

  

Dana Glabau: Do Cyborgs Have Politics?

Transhumanism: using technology to extend human capabilities

Cyborg: mixed semiotic ideological tool for analyzing what kind of technology we want to bring into the world

-rejects purity, made of parts not quite a whole

-of human and animal life

-reject dualisms used for power reinforcement (mind/body, culture/nature, male/female, civilized/primitive, reality/appearance, whole/part, agent/resource, maker/made, active/passive, right/wrong, truth/illusion, total/partial, God/man)
