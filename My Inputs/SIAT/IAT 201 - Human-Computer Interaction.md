3. Organization/ Synthesis
    

  

Natasha Jen:

1. Evidence
    
2. Outcome
    
3. Critique
    

  

Unflattening (Sousanis):

-combine conflicting perspectives for depth and richness

  

Simon: Design is Science of Artificial

How does knowledge inform design?

-scientific method to build/test theories about world

-design is science of artificial using design methods to improve some situation, make sure it world in any set of conditions

-means-end analysis (compares design relative to goals)

-satisficing (happens when a design is good enough to implement)

  
  

Sch√∂n: Reflective Practice: actively seek to improve![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/5hDb7bwL10GKwbV4Fijd5jZoj5vL36eWA7gzueeLtLnGiFNhgg4oAn80X5kieq1NDd07XuyhYBaJa-BFbhFSeWrbqHZENnqSigL2LfmmXpXr2dw3KAlMZA73DQ0Dgpum2nUqa8jEKKLsU1JnPYJd_A)

How can I use knowledge in my design practice?

-studied how other professionals improved

-question, information, analuze

  

Arthur: [[The Nature of Technology]], what it is/how it evolves

How is technology design special?

-technology harnesses phenomenon to achieve design objective

-provides capability based on principle of X

-method technologies combine to make complex technologies

-tech designers learn language of method technologies, command of language makes you effective designer

-usually improves incrementally, improves dramatically when new phenomena used

If we are to ‚Äúspeak‚Äù psychology, language includes:

1. Graphical (audible, tactile) environs for perception
    
2. Interactive experiences for enactive cognition
    
3. Communication channels for social cognition¬†
    

¬†By combining these ‚Äúphrases‚Äù we can generate applications that are visually pleasing and easy to use, that enable cognitive tasks, and that support social interaction, collaboration, and communication

  

Norman: Cognitive Engineering

How do we build the knowledge we need to do all this?

-applying cognitive science to design of machines

-lack of knowledge

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/zaR4c_jZ6YlgRW0pk2pgFiEUrwGZTCJrO6ld2sVoZ1yBIHB5cVJB0gFuXfVivUfhmrHsAQGN3B49VwcjZT-AXVWq1Av8aL5kF7sxqw03DxhHCH3t_dyjS6NQ-OBNC5PGQlY2QADVSHbbiUz7fcpWpg)

  

Real Design Thinking:

-hard, addresses wicked problems (ill-defined, changing requirements)

-design is fundamental act of intelligence

  

Design Learning from Science:

  

Theory of Science: ‚Äúthe scientific method‚Äù (Popper, Lakatos)¬†

-seeks to disprove theories

-scientists make bold predictions in the form of testable hypotheses

-experiments should be designed to falsify those predictions¬†

Paradigms: irreconcilable theories dealing with different situations

  

Goals of Science:

1. natural philosophy (basic, pure science)
    
2. applications (technoscience, applied science)
    

  

The Scientific Attitude (McIntyre)

Scientists:

1. produce predictive theories
    
2. value/seek out evidence
    
3. change theories based on evidence
    

  

Theory of Design Evaluation (Avi Soudack)¬†

‚ÄúDesign is a hypothesis‚Äù-- If I do X users will do Y¬†

The designer is predicting the user‚Äôs behaviour, e.g. ‚ÄúIf I put a button here and

make it look like this, then the user will see it and know that they should click it

next.‚Äù Making such predictions explicit focuses your usability reviews and

research, and allows you to test the design, not the users.¬†

  

Criteria for Scientific Theory:

1. falsifiable predictions
    
2. supported by independent sources of evidence
    
3. consistent with pre-existing theories/results
    
4. adapted and modified to account for new evidence
    

Models:

1. Conceptual Model: metaphorically describe a phenomenon
    
2. Computational Model: computer programs making prediction based on algorithm
    
3. Computational Theories: computer program simulating real-life causal relationships

- Describe the rise of professional psychology in America.¬†
    
- What is the value for design? Why bother with the history of psychology?¬†
    

  

Perspective 1: psychology to find basic mechanisms of mind, should be experimental science like physics

Experiments: simple tasks

1. Structuralism: (Wundt, Tichner) studying structure of mind by comparing experience of senses to external reality
    

Wilhelm Wundt: "Father of Psychology" focused on introspection to identify elements of consciousness (Phenomenology, philosophy and art)

2. Human-Information Processing: how information is detected and processed by the brain/mind
    

Von Helmholtz , Gustav, Fechner: (HIP Psych) Measured relationships between experience of senses and external reality (psychophysics)¬†

Perspective 2: psychology as environmental adaptation, look at ecology of mind

Experiments: complex tasks and stimuli

1. Functionalism: (James) consciousness studied as continuous whole, adaptation to structured world
    

William James' ‚ÄúPrinciples of Psychology‚Äù: consciousness should be studied as a continuous whole (Ecological psychology)

2. Situated (4E) cognotion examines interplay of mind and world
    

  

Johnson: Designing with the Mind in Mind:

- We perceive what we expect¬†
    
- Our vision is optimized to see structure¬†
    
- We seek and use visual structure¬†
    
- Reading is unnatural¬†
    
- Our color vision is limited¬†
    
- Our peripheral vision is poor
    
- Our attention is limited
    
- Our memory is imperfect¬†
    
- Limits on attention shape our thought & action¬†
    
- Recognition is easy; recall is hard¬†
    
- Learning from experience & performing learned actions are easy; problem-solving & calculation are hard¬†
    
- Many factors affect learning¬†
    
- We have real-time requirements
    

  

HCI HISTORY:

HCI: reducing the BS

-designing interactions/interfaces to afford interactions actions between humans activity and computational systems supporting them

-deals with people and computers

-considers cultural, social, organizational, cognitive and perceptual issues

-draws from psychology, ergonomics, computer science, graphic/product design, anthropology, engineering

-informed design is better design, designers should know science

  

Pre 1970s:¬†

-design, art, architecture schools teach creative design

-programmers build text/key interfaces (so simple there is no need for designers)

  

1970s: sciences of artificial (Simon)

-need more science considered in design, human factors, ergonomics for factory/military

  

1980s: 1st Wave HCI: Human Information Processing - focus on usability

(Norman)

-usability testing, human information processing, interface control, CHI

-how brain processes info, cognitive performance (human information processing (HIP))

-Sch√∂n The Reflective Practitioner

-Suchman lays groundwork for 2nd wave with Plans and Situated Actions

  

1990s: 2nd Wave HCI: Social Science Approach - for industry use

(Suchman)

-Suchman Plans and Situated Actions uses social science theory, collaborative work, social software

-technology/ organization to improve performance

-GUI becomes ubiquitous

  

2000s: 3rd Wave HCI: Design Perspective - user experience design

-social/ cognitive sciences invite designers back (designers too involved, people began to object)

-role of designed environment in cognition and action

-design, social and cognitive sciences

-mobile computing, Facebook, Apple, Google

  

B√∏dker: What have we left behind?

Home: designerly (3rd wave)

Work: social sciences (2nd wave)

-only focusing on aesthetics is stupid/easy/limits user use

  

2010s: Multiwave Integrative HCI:

-Arthur: The Nature of Technology

-VR, more mobile platforms

-HCI community split into sectors (design, engineering, management)

-perceptual/ cognitive/ experimental

-sociocultural/ qualitative

-design methods

Perception:

  

Sensation: physical process of senses responding to stimuli

Perception: psychological process of making sense of stimuli

  

Transduction: converting one type of energy into another

Absolute Threshold: amount of stimulation needed to detect stimulus

Signal Detection: way we measure absolute thresholds

Differential Threshold/Just Noticeable Difference (JND): ability to detect difference of 2 stimuli of different intensities

Weber‚Äôs Law: bigger stimuli require bigger differences to be noticed

Bottom-Up Processing: first time you have new experience

Top-Down Processing: biases from past experience change perception

Sensory Adaptation: stop paying attention to consistent stimulus

Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex: move head one way eyes move other to continue looking at target

Synthesia: one sensory signal gives rise to 2+ sensory signals

  

Spatial Vision: how we see objects in world (general display design)

Spatial Attention: how we select what to process (complex display design)

Visual Orientation: how we understand environment we are in (VR/AR design)

Colour Vision: how we interpret light (general display design)

  

Vision:

Noba Chapter 3:

Outcomes:

- Describe how the eye transforms light information into neural energy.¬†
    
- Understand what sorts of information the brain is interested in extracting from the environment and why it is useful.¬†
    
- Describe how the visual system has adapted to deal with different lighting conditions.¬†
    
- Understand the value of having two eyes.¬†
    
- Understand why we have color vision.¬†
    
- Understand the interdependence between vision and other brain functions.
    
- What is the value for design?
    

  

Overview of vision:

1. Light as information source
    
2. Detecting and focusing light
    
3. Sensing light with 2 receptor types (cones/rods)
    
4. Neural signals (transduction)
    
5. Processing neural data
    

  

Perspective 1: HIP: cognition a form of computation

sensation -> perception -> cognition -> action

-perceptual experiments in colour matching and mixing easily map onto response of retinal cones and ganglia¬†

  

Perspective 2: Ecological: affordances, we are integral part of environment, adapted

-ecology of vision in animals, culture in humans

-neuroanatomical analysis of retinas finds patterns that are a function of behaviour, rather than the objective world-- e.g. birds are specialized for flight

  

Process of vision:

1. Light enters through pupil
    
2. Light is projected onto retina
    
3. Light is transduced into neural energy by photoreceptors
    

Rods:¬†

Photoactivation: photochemical reaction when light hits eye photoreceptors, produces neural signals

4. Photoreceptors send signal to nervous system to analyze
    

Contrast: boundaries of objects, helps us detect objects in space

Lateral Inhibition: neurons exaggerate contrast so you don‚Äôt miss it. 2 signals:

1. Output signal for next level of vision processing
    
2. Lateral signal to inhibit neurons next to it (redundant to have both signals, more light/contrast = more inhibition)
    

Contrast Gain: visual system determines mean contrast in scane, represents values around that contrast best

  

5. Neurons project signal into thalamus
    

1. Subcortical Regions (old brain): computations for reflexive eye movement
    
2. Primary Visual Cortex (new brain): complex computations, neurons reconstruct scene and identify colour, lines
    

Ventral (What) Pathway: visual recognition

Dorsal (Where and How) Pathway: motion, interaction, navigation, obstacle avoidance

  

Colour:

- HIP colour theory (see Noba too)¬†
    
- Trichomatic colour: Brain and perception¬†
    
- Opponent colour: Brain and perception¬†
    
- Ecological colour theory: Environment and perception¬†
    
- Evolution of colour vision¬†
    
- Vision for activities¬†
    
- Animals for survival¬†
    
- Humans in their culture
    

  

1. Classic View of Colour (Munsell):¬†
    

-3 color dimensions that are perceptually uniform and independent dimensions

Hue

Value (light/brightness)

Chroma (purity)

  

2. HIP Theory of Colour (mind as computer):
    

  

1. Trichromacy (Helmholtz) (Marr‚Äôs mechanism level)
    

-cones respond preferentially to red, green, blue

-3 primary colours (from 3 kinds of cones) can be mixed to make any colour

-perceptual experiments in colour matching and mixing easily map onto response of retinal cones and ganglia

Support: primaries can mix to make any color (rgb screen), red-green deficiency

  

2. Opponent-Process Theory (Hering)
    

-cones send information to retinal ganglion cells that respond to pairs of colours (RG, YB, BW), take information from cones and compete difference between colours

-cones and ganglia become fatigued (afterimage)

-red/green wired to oppose each other

AfterImage: green cones start getting exhausted, when remove light just red cones remain firing¬†

  

3. Modern Colour Theory (combined)
    

-see many colours from 3 receptors with variable sensitivity to each colour

  

3. ¬†Ecological Theory of Colour (humans as adaptive organisms):
    

-some illusions are hard to explain with HIP, we need another system

Semiotic View: colours are determined by interaction of organism and environment

1. organisms adapted to environment
    
2. based on ecology in animals, culture in humans
    
3. colour as affordance: something in environment that affords an action
    

Constraints:

Gamma, x, ultraviolet rays blocked by upper atmosphere

Visible light observable from earth with some atmospheric distortion

Infrared absorbed by atmospheric gases

Radio waves observable from earth but invisible

Colour Constancy: we interpret colours based on surrounding context

Colour Vision in Animals:¬†

-colors are properties of the world that result from animal environment codetermination, varies widely across species (type/amount of colour vision)

-animals‚Äô visual capabilities are adapted to their environment¬†

Aquatic animal cone pigments match the colour of their water, 4 cone pigments for twice the range of colour vision, polarization sensitive vision in cuttlefish¬†

Birds have cone pigments & coloured oil filters for many primary colours, polarization sensitive vision for wayfinding¬†

Insect vision highly specialized, plants have evolved UV patterns for bees etc.¬†

Color Vision in Humans:

-impacted by culture/language

  

4. Marr: putting together all three views
    

1. Computation/Ecological: What does vision need to do? What capabilities does it give us to live in our environment?
    
2. Algorithm/Mind Processing: how we think of/understanding the visual world through knowledge and experience¬†
    
3. Mechanism/Implementation(HIP)/Brain: how brain/eyes turn light into knowledge of world¬†
    

  

Gestalt Psychology: vision is holistic, visual relationships can be implied

-were seeking qualitative explanations for human performance

-observed regularities in perception of patterns (Gestalt = form or shape) in the

visual world  
-conclude that scenes appear as they do by because of the relations between

the parts¬†

-used simple graphics to test this experimentally

1. Proximity: relative distance between objects effects group perception
    
2. Similarity: look similar = grouped/related
    
3. Continuity: biased to perceive continuous forms rather than segment (fill in to reduce ambiguity)
    
4. Closure: close open objects to see as whole (not pieces)
    
5. Symmetry: organize data to give it symmetry, parse to reduce complexity
    
6. Figure/Ground: mind separates stimulus into foreground/background
    
7. Common Fate: move together = perceived as grouped/related
    

  

Bias in Perception:

1. Experience Bias: you see what you expect
    

Familiar Perceptual Frames: shortcut using past experience to inform present actions

Habituation: repeated exposure to stimuli dulls sensitivity

Attentional Blink: 0.15-0.45 seconds after see/recognize something important we are deaf/blind to all other stimuli

2. Context Bias: perception shaped by context
    

McGurk Effect: hear syllable indicated by lip movement not auditory cue

3. Goal Bias: perceive what is relevant/interesting, only see what looking for
    

Design Implementation:

-avoid ambiguity

-be consistent

-understand goals

Attention:

James: taking possession of the mind, essence of consciousness

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/qAquJPGjb6rhjmW1KVipCKdz6eY52WFyrvLIWLEtHme7Is9c-Khja5RU6rkbtUaKmcMM4uV8ChN_8S2_ec9_XQkuZtXT_BQykljxrHARs5XdevrZaTNWMn4jSCv8up6tmKoPiOqI5Ix9LBjcwVhLbQ)

Selective Attention: some information is consciously focused on, other information is ignored

Sustained Attention: maintaining attention over long period of time

Divided Attention: focusing on multiple events at once

Spatial Attention: how focus moves around environment

  

1. Selective Attention Experience
    

-where thoughts and sense inputs meet, interface between mind and world

-‚Äúflow‚Äù state attention to task

-James: something possesses the mind consciously or unconsciously¬†

  

2. HIP Model (where/what/when?)
    

Overt Orientation: moving physical body to get information

Covert Orientation: mentally concentrating on specific event

Endogenous Attention: covert orienting on specific stimuli intentionally

Exogenous Attention: attention is captured by sensory event unintentionally

Selective Attention: limited capacity for attention leads to selective attention

-perceptually rich environments too much for higher processes to process

Attentional Token: FINST hotlink between mental process and thing perceived in environment

Auditory Attention:

1. Broadbent Model:
    

-senses can process multiple objects/events at the same time, but too much information can overload cognitive processes

-filter allows attended source to pass, but stores the other source in a buffer for later processing¬†

-cognitive processes only have access to filtered data¬†

-attention creates a ‚Äúbottleneck‚Äù to prevent cognition from getting too much information

Early Selection: ignored data not processed (filter at perception)![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/bmJk2aNB_3rEGim3JqvyUOhtljjtCYCa_TKP26Xh_8C9fOPGFmxIJaIwSuxbS9ioh_6-09IOmmQApTMSeSSMsq4dnQa0KhHNHCghwD6w0Gt7BAMkp3yDIfTBIQacV7X6KSSynq8bAXaCTcgPVRVPoQ)

2. Treisman Model (attention to sound, replicated broadbent‚Äôs study):
    

-Anne Treisman replicated Broadbent‚Äôs study, with different results: Sometimes sound can ‚Äúbreak through‚Äù Broadbent‚Äôs filter and be heard¬†

-This happens when the word in the unattended ear is very relevant to the content of the attended ear¬†![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/-tJqfhtynig-FjbRww7LVYioDADnOdCkcvYNJ0qfPmGExdDdWOzhMK57jinXKgvSD_wO3tzCiSGa3meFM7HJqqZ0Hth0MNco0uubiGEZCuHEIJaJ8jKxulJoE9fhFoiolR71U4HQri32kL_IKwkAfQ)

  

-It seems cognitive processes (e.g. understanding meaning of words) can override the filter

-selection starts at physical/perceptual level but ignored information is not entirely blocked out

-cognitive processes can break through filter when recognized/interesting content

-not enough capacity, analysis stops

Midway Selection: threshold of consciousness reached before information can break through, threshold midway through information processing

Visual Attention:

3. Deutsch and Deutsch Model:
    

-all information is analyzed for meaning, only relevant information enters consciousness

-we have subliminal responses to the meaning of items that we are not conscious of hearing/seeing¬†

Late Selection: all information processed

4. Multimode Model:
    

-stage where selection occurs changes depending on task/environment

High Perceptual Load: early selection

Low Perceptual Load: late selection

  

3. Bridging Theories (Attention in scenes):
    

  

Location-Based:

1. Posner: attention is spotlight illuminating area to improve perception (moves around to different stimuli)
    
2. Eriksen: attention is zoom lens (zoom in for max power, zoom out for less power)
    

  

Object-Based:

1. Treisman: attention is glue for feature integration
    

Feature-Integration Theory:

-attention ties visual features together, we can search for a unique target on any feature dimension (colour, shape) but not a unique combination of features

Parallel Search: uses one part of brain, focus on one aspect, fast

Serial Search: two parts of brain, focus on many aspects, slow

Object File: in memory with history, changes of object

Illusory Conjunction: features present are wrongly attributed to

same object (avoid!!!)

2. Pylyshym: Attentional Tokens/FINSTs monitor
    

-~4 objects indexed for enhanced processing

-remaining stimuli receive limited processing

-explains Gestault psychology of group perception

Gestault Psychology: grouped perception captures patterns that

characterize physical world (ecological validity)

  

Inattentional Blindness: failure to notice unexpected event when focused on something else

-can only process one stream of information at once

-greater attention demand = more likely to miss external events

  

THE MIND: design language of cognition

  

Learning and Memory: mental representations

Outcomes:

- Define and note differences between the following forms of memory: working memory, episodic memory, semantic memory, collective memory.
    
- Describe the three stages in the process of learning and remembering.
    
- Describe strategies that can be used to enhance the original learning or encoding of information.
    
- Describe strategies that can improve the process of retrieval.
    
- Describe why the classic mnemonic device, the method of loci, works so well.¬†
    

  

Noba Memory:

Working Memory: briefly hold information while working with it

Episodic Memory: remembering episodes of one‚Äôs life

Semantic Memory: general knowledge of facts of world

  

Memory is composed of:

1. Encoding: learning by perceiving information and applying/relating it to past knowledge
    

-if not encoded, not remembered, if encoded may be remembered

1. Selective: attend to some events, ignore others
    
2. Prolific: always encoding events, attending to/trying to understand the world
    

Distinctiveness: key to remembering events (includes vivid emotion)

Flashbulb Memory (Brown and Kulik): vivid memory of finding out piece of news

-not that accurate¬†

Recoding: taking information in delivered form and converting it to be understandable, encoded memory is always recoded

-can introduce errors when accidentally add information in encoding and remember new memories as part of experience

Inference: not explicit but able to guess undisclosed intention

-humans are always making inferences and can mix them up with actual evidence

1. Pragmatic: one common/likely inference
    
2. Logical: what actually makes sense (many options)
    

Strategies: form distinct links, relate to what you already know, imagine events, associate information with images

  

2. Storage: maintaining information over time
    

Memory Traces/Enegram: every experience we have changes our brain at a physical, neurochemical level

Consolidation: neural changes occurring after learning in order to make memory trace

-remembering is reconstructing (not reproducing) event with aid of memory traces

Retention Interval: time between learning and testing, memories can consolidate during this time, improving memory

Retroactive Interference: new activities during retention interval that interfere with old memory retrieval

Proactive Interference: old memories interfere with new memory encoding

Misinformation Effect: the accounts of others bias your memory

  

3. Retrieval: accessing information when needed (key to memory improvement)
    

-most important? if cannot retrieve a memory is useless

Available Information: all information stored in brain

Accessible Information: retrievable information (just a slice of memory)

Cues are how we retrieve:

Encoding Specificity Principle: we encode memory in specific, individual and intertwined ways

-if retrieval cue matches memory trace of experience, memory will be evoked

Cue Overload Principle: for cue to work it can‚Äôt match too many other experiences (distinctiveness)

Recognition Failure of Recallable Words: highlights point that cue will be most effective depending on how information has been encoded (best cues recreate event where encoded)

-each retrieval changes the memory

Testing Effect: retrieval increases future retrieval (a lot)

Retrieval-Induced Forgetting: retrieving some information can cause us to forget other (a little bit)

  

Improving Memory:

Mnemonic Devices: associating memory with word, peg words to hang memories

  
HIP View of Memory: from perception to action

-close to cognitive architecture, unchanging

1. Perception
    

1. Sensory Memory:
    

Buffers: short-term memory storage until information is used (unaware but present)

Iconic: visual, brief flash <1 second store

Echoic: auditory, <5 second store, can rewind a sound

Haptic: touch

-limited processing, logic of perception, sensory learning

-passes into short-term memory by attention (filtering)

2. Cognition
    

1. Working Memory: faster access, rapid decay
    

Central Executive: coordinates the processes, controls

1. Visual-Spatial Scratchpad: working memory for events in visual space
    
2. Articulatory/Phonological Loop: working memory for sounds/language
    

-limited capacity (7 +- 2), chunk information to extend this (phone #s)

-‚Äùflush‚Äù information when finished task

-requires effort, attention to task, strategy

-moves into long-term via rehearsal

Chunking: putting information together to extend (4+-1 chunks)

2. Long-term Memory: slower access, little decay, larger
    

-unlimited capacity

-events, episodic, procedural

-retrieval is complicated operation that depends on recent access

1. Semantic: knowledge of world
    
2. Episodic: autobiographical recall of events/life experiences
    
3. Procedural: memory of a sequence, can become automatic through practice
    

3. Motor
    

1. Motor Memory: established through rehearsal
    

-motor programs/perception-action loop

  

Expertise:

Expert: master of one domain only

-chunking information, chunking chunks

-memory pegs (using words to associate with other words)

-memory palaces (walking through a space, associating info with images)

-organize knowledge differently due to deeper understanding, more of actions are automatic

Practice: IQ, short-term memory, reading speed, reasoning ability, attention are not predictive of superior performance in a domain

-10,000 hours of deliberate practice (highly motivated with careful self-monitoring) to become an expert

  

GOMS in HCI:

Goals: what do you want to do

Operators: primitive tasks

Methods: sequences of operators

Selections: deciding what method is applicable

Keystroke Level Model (KLM): provides crude task-execution times based on cognitive factors (only for procedural/routine knowledge, designer must know top-level tasks and user goals to design effectively)

  

Modeling Psychology:¬†

-can only model cognitive architecture (aspects that are universal)

Computational Theories: creating program with cognitive architecture, test task performance¬†

Machine Learning:

Early AI: goal was to make synthetic humans, based on computational models of humans

Current AI: goal is to do tasks better than humans/tasks humans aren‚Äôt good at

-uses brute force methods to compare all options

Machine Learning: systems ‚Äúlearn: through experience

-like alien intelligence that thinks differently from humans

-human tendency to anthropomorphize leads to us confusing intelligent behaviour with intelligence

-makes dumb mistakes because can‚Äôt see full picture

  

Mental Models in Conceptual Design:

1. Cognitive Models:
    

-designing systems understandable to user

-assisting user to build useful mental models (providing only good moves)

1. System Model: what designers see
    

-lower-level abstraction, actual details may be hidden

2. Mental Model: what users think they see
    

User Illusion: system behaves the way user thinks it should

-goal is to match mental model to system model

2. Mental Models:
    

1. State-Transition Model: changes in state are visible
    
2. Object-Action Model: users think in terms of concrete/abstract objects, system supports action on objects
    
3. Mapping Models: users learn sequence of actions to accomplish tasks
    
4. Analogies: new system resembles old system
    

Guidelines for Effective Mental Models:

1. choose MM early in design
    
2. link MM to style of interaction
    
3. hide system features that conflict with MM
    
4. exploit system image to preserve MM
    
5. ensure correct and consistent design
    
6. simple metaphors
    
7. works for variety of expertise
    

Cognitive Walkthrough: debug mental model by examining processes

Design to Support Users Mental Model Building:

1. During System Usage: activity leads to mental model
    

-explanatory theory developed by user used to predict future system behaviour

2. Observing Others Using System: casual/formal observation of others
    
3. Reading About System: documentation, help screens
    

Users‚Äô Runnable Models:

-dynamic, simple models (doing this will result in that)

-used for explanation (why did it respond that way?)

-used for prediction (selecting appropriate action, Normal forming an intention to act)

Guiding MM Formation (Norman):

System Image: visible, audible, touchable behaviour

Conceptual Design: constructing the system image so user creates useful mental model (change with experience)

Complex System MMs:

-hierarchical object-action model (causal relations between elements)

-becomes more complex and all-encompassing with experience

  

Learning:

Perceptual Learning: brain response to auditory/perceptual information changes with experience

Implicit Learning: change behaviour without intending to learn something

Implicit Memory: change behaviour based on past experience without meaning to

Nonassociative Learning: repeated exposure to stimuli leads to change in response

1. Habituation: decreased response
    
2. Sensitization: increased response
    

Classical Conditioning: learning relationships between events

Operant Conditioning: change behaviour in response to reinforcement

  

Conditions Affecting Learning:

1. Learners: motivation, organization, planning skills
    

Working Memory: capacity of information worked with at once (anxiety reduces)

-expertise/familiarity leads to chunking

2. Encoding Activities: intentional learning can be less effective than unintentional
    

-encoding strategy more important than motivation

-distributive practice better because practicing recall

General Principles of Learning:

1. effective metacognition (evaluate learning and understanding)
    
2. transfer-appropriate processing (memory is better when test is same knowledge of original encoding activity)
    
3. the value of forgetting (keep only relevant knowledge easily accessible)
    

  

Recognition and Recall:

Recognition: perception and long-term memory working together

-brain designed to recognize neural pattern from perception based on stimuli and context (similar context = similar neural pattern)

-neural patterns can be activated by 1. perceptions and 2. other brain activity

-similar neural pattern is activated more easily each time

Recall: long-term memory activating old neural patterns without a perception trigger

-harder because brain is not designed to recall facts

GUI Implications:¬†

1. see and choose > recall and type
    
2. pictures to convey function
    

1. thumbnails
    
2. larger number of people using function = bigger function
    
3. visual cues to recognize where user is
    
4. make authentication info easy to recall
    

  

Learning from Experience:

Brain:

1. Old Brain (brain stem)
    

-classifies everything into edible, dangerous or sexy

-automatic functions

2. Midbrain (above old, beneath cortex)
    

-controls emotions

3. New Brain (cerebral cortex)
    

-intentional, purposeful, conscious activity amd planning

Mind:

1. System One: unconscious (old and midbrain): primary controller of human behaviour
    

-perception and behaviour

-fast, guess, approximation

-easily biased (answers by subbing easier question, base judgements on what it perceives, filters perception based on goals and beliefs)

2. System Two: conscious (new brain): rational, flexible decisions
    

-rational, conscious monitoring, careful consideration

-what makes us us

-often lazy and accepts judgements of system one (usually asleep unless solving novel problem)

  

Learning from Experience is Easy:

-generalizing information and adjusting behaviour happens unconsciously (old/midbrain can do it, new brain recognized you have done it)

Limitations:

1. complex situations with many variables
    
2. experiences from our lives/people we know influence us disproportionately
    
3. learn wrong lesson from mistake (root cause not deduced)
    
4. overgeneralize based on incomplete data (necessary adaptation for real life
    

  

Performing Learned Actions is Easy:

-learned processes can become automatic, only performed by system one

-automatic actions can be done in parallel with other things/unconsciously¬†

  

Performing Novel Actions is Hard:

-consciously attending to everything makes us overwhelmed (can only attend to 4 +- 1 thing)

-prefer automatic methods when trying to get something done (system one handling reduces time, effort, error)

  

Problem Solving and Calculation are Hard:

-math is new, brain is not designed to do calculations

-need new brain to cope with novel issues

-greater cortex size = greater interpreting and planning abilities

-requires focused attention and constant conscious monitoring (slow)

-new brain is impulse control

-solving technical problems requires training, effort, motivating (reward worth work)

  

Design Implications:

-people have goals they want to accomplish easily

-indicate status/goal progress

-guide user towards goal

-tell users exactly what they need to know

-don‚Äôt make users diagnose system problems

-minimize number and complexity of settings

-perception > calculation

-make system familiar

  

Intelligence and IQ: multiple intelligence, intelligent systems & distributed cognition¬†

  

Intelligence Testing:

  

1. Psychology View:¬†
    

Spearman: general factor (g), if people are good at one intellectual area, likely good at many

Galton: individual differences (heredity) and intelligence, crude measurement, factor exploitation, g factors and causes

Binet: formalized intelligence testing into IQ tests for schools testing child intelligence (finding intelligent children to educate)

Intelligence Quotient (IQ): child‚Äôs mental age (test score) / childs actual age

-difference in ‚Äúg‚Äù predicts success

-intelligence is cognitive/linguistic

Simon: partnered with Binet to produce first IQ test

Terman: standardized Binet-Simon test into Stanford-Binet using bell curve

Wescheler: responds to criticism of Stanford-Binet with Wechsler Adult

Intelligence Scale (WAIS)

-wide range of intellectual abilities (remember, compute, understand language,

reason, process information quickly)

  

Types of Intelligence:

  

2. Gibson: Ecological View
    

-rejecting HIP model in favour of invariants in optic array (learning to filter attention)

-gannet diving to get fish, keep glint at end of beak (simple heuristic)

  

3. HIP View: processing capability
    

General Intelligence (g): ability to reason about variety of things, predicts life success

Intelligence tests: standardized, normed on curve

Criticism: culturally biased

Flynn Effect: curving scored hid that people‚Äôs raw scores are getting higher

-largely due to increase in sensory (visual) intelligence and increased health

-we have learned language of rich visual interactions (movies/TV, graphical design, web/info viz design)

  

4. Caroll: Human Cognitive Abilities using Factor Analysis¬†
    

-divides intelligence into 3 levels (abstract to concrete)![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/b-J6rS4XjCZO9e2hNQc11b6FItZrH3qGO5OkNPlMTzppE_XFwWHMhC5s_mM1H4sIpSR5GHcwhuvG1p8EexJS2rP2xy-NIPoJ1_qS3DJG39GfsKa-Qjjbiv26ZPeZ0nqElQy8SLSWoA4_vUrhqBYmTA)

-intelligence can be perceptual

  

Fluid Intelligence: problem solving on the fly, ability to learn novel tasks

Crystalized Intelligence: expertise, deeply established

  
  
  
  

Deconstructing Intelligence:

-IQ is as measurable is a flawed construct (who decides what is included, weighted, important in IQ tests?)

Controversy:¬†

-IQ tests focus on internal validity: are tests predictor of test score

-critique is external validity: are tests predictor of life outcomes/abilities

  

5. Gardener: Theory of Multiple Intelligences
    

-abandoning g for specific capabilities¬†

1. logic-math
    
2. visual-spatial
    
3. music-rhythm
    
4. verbal-linguistic
    
5. bodily-kinesthetic
    
6. interpersonal
    
7. intrapersonal
    
8. naturalistic
    

  

6. Distributed Cognition View on Intelligence:

-no longer psychology only, world/environment is part of intelligence (affordances)

  

7. Embodiment and Intelligence:

Tversky‚Äôs 9 Laws of Cognition:

1. there are no benefits without costs
    
2. action moulds perception
    
3. feelings come first
    
4. the mind can override perception
    
5. cognition mirrors perception
    
6. spatial thinking is the foundation of abstract thought
    
7. the mind fills in missing information
    
8. when though overflows we put thought into the world (representations)
    
9. we organize the world the way we organize our mind
    

  

Implications for Design:

-unconscious inference from perceptual/implicit learning and implicit memory

-good design (affordance) makes you ‚Äúsmart‚Äù

  

Affordances: how we think & act in the environment

Affordance: environment presents possibility for action

-relation of user and object

1. Physical: allows an action
    

-we create objects to help us understand the world

-world shapes mind, mind shapes world

-recognize objects by recognizing invariants

2. Static: generate action sequences
    

-solve problems based on bodily interaction

Norman: HCI could benefit from static affordance

3. Dynamic: senses as perceptual systems
    

-visually guided by stimuli

Gibson: perception-action patterns are basic element of intelligence

Perceived Affordance: what person thinks something can do

Signifier: makes affordance clearer, bridges gap between perceived and actual affordance

Anti-Affordance: something that prohibits interaction, something you can‚Äôt do

Hostile Design: designed to prevent certain activities (sleeping, skateboarding on benches)

Dark Patterns: trick users into doing things by accident that they don‚Äôt want to do but benefits company

-exploiting psychology and learned associations

Roach Motel: easy to get it, hard to get out

  

Norman: The Psychopathy of Everyday Things

2 of most important design characteristics:

1. Discoverability: how can operations be discovered? (relevant components visible, communicate possible actions/where/how they should be done
    
2. Understanding: what does object mean? (what is intended use, what do functions/controls/settings mean?)
    

Industrial Design: focus on function, value, appearance of object for user and manufacturer

Interaction Design: focus on how users interact with product

Experience Design: focus on creating a quality/enjoyable experience

-tailor machines and processes to people, not people to machines

Human-Centered Design: putting human capacities, needs and behaviour first, accommodating design to them, understanding people and technology, based on observation of users (people unaware of needs and difficulties)

Fundamental Principles of Interaction:

1. Affordances: possibilities of action, can be invisible
    

-relationship between object and person, determined by capacities of person and possible object uses, not a property but a relationship

Anti-Affordance: prevents an interaction

Perceived Affordance: often act as signifier but can be ambiguous

Gibson: worlds contains clues picked up by direct perception, requires no interpretation, just perceived

-combined information pickup from all senses determines perception without internal processing or cognition

-physical objects convey how to interact with them (root of affordance)

2. Signifiers: signals of appropriate interaction, must be perceivable
    

-communicate where action of affordance should take place, purpose, structure, operation of object, any perceivable indicator communicating appropriate behaviour

-more important than affordances (can‚Äôt use functions if don‚Äôt know how)

3. Mapping: forming a relationship between elements of two sets of things (controls to device being controlled)
    

-only works if compelling conceptual model to understand why (accuracy irrelevant)

Natural Mapping: taking advantage of spatial analogies, yields immediate understanding, culturally sensitive

4. Constraints
    
5. Feedback: letting you know system is working on your request
    

-must be immediate

-convey what has happened

-too much feedback makes you ignore all of it

6. Conceptual Models: simplified explanation of how something works (don‚Äôt have to be accurate), only useful if assumptions supporting them hold true
    

Mental Model: conceptual model representing person‚Äôs understanding of how something works, informed from system image, predict success with device (can figure out how to use, deal when things go wrong)

System Image: information available to us about device (physical, informational, experiential), burden of designer to user communication

-added benefits of technology = more to control = more to be confused about

-design takes collaborative efforts of many disciplines¬†

The ENVIRONMENT: Distributed Cognition

Distributed Cognition: role of environment in thinking process

-shifting from brain-as-computer to cognitive systems in the environment

-ecological perception is precursor to D-Cog

  

Elements of Distributed Cognition:

1. Smart-Seeing: external representation to support cognition
    

-see what‚Äôs before you, link to understanding based on expertise

-know what things mean based on expertise

2. Projecting: using external representation to ‚Äúsee‚Äù next move/event
    

-interaction of internal and external representations

Perception: what is present (basic forms, colour, shapes, categorized objects)

Projection: what could be present, learned, way of seeing extra information, implications of object (what it stands for? what can be done with it? next move?)

3. Close-coupling: skilled human and active/responsive artifact
    

-becoming one with process through control, immersion, flow

-action and environment interaction (gannet in environment)

  

Science of Distributed Cognition:

1. Smart Seeing/Projecting: using static images, symbols, visualization
    
2. Close Coupling of human and computer with active coordination of dynamic systems of user engagement (games)
    

-how thinker changes mental operations to better coordinate with speed of information

3. Socially Distributed Cognition: human-human coordination of thought and action supported by environments, artifacts, displays, sub-tasks, signalling mechanisms
    

-how thinker understands actions taken by ‚Äúagents‚Äù (AI and human)

  

Designing Cognitive Systems:

1. offload cognition to manipulatable representations (smart-seeing/projecting)
    

-when thought overflows the mind, the mind puts it into the world

-thinking distributed between internal process and external representation/tool -actively looking at representations and projecting onto them makes us more powerful thinkers than thinking in our heads alone

-interacting with external representation is part of thinking

2. close-couple skilled human and active/responsive artifact (musical instrument, games)¬†
    
3. distribute problem across people with action scripts, discussion, action coordination¬†
    

-uses social intelligence (roles to play, signifiers, direct communication)

Phenomena:

-roles/parts to play

-timing (what to do when, rules/procedures)

-passing information (text, symbols, voice, video)

-read meters, transform information

-group structure is often emergent (not defined, improvised based on actions of others)

Methods for Multi-Agent Systems:

-language of interactions with other agents

-mental models of agents (are they active or do they have agency?)

-communication methods

-interface signifiers

Signifiers: any physically perceivable cue, accidental or not, can have multiple purposes, more important than affordance

-understand people take action for a reason. if we understand reason we understand actions

  

Design Implications:![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/deOj1VG9DMjGs7LGkWoUmQud25KZCgou3eapd6NdoFoKMpNV2ls5EStiEYqxEZGXWiVt_qsy4bfi1anonIg24JuWmypkZG4JtiqagQoWJXzOfeWp6eTuHmT6VYE0XI24ssoaR3WLyfC2WNN4cr6xfA)

-symbol use to augment human intelligence

-thinking with hands

  

Good vs. Bad Computers: answer depends on design

Bad: technologies generate events that disrupt prefrontal processes, trying to keep up with computer

Good: video games improve fluid intelligence

  

Cognitive Science: uniting many fields who relate to consciousness

Wave 1 HCI: Cognitive Psychology

-perceptual cognition from HIP psychology

-reasoning using mental representations, concepts, categories

Wave 2 HCI: Social Science

-social cognition and coordination with people and groups

Wave 3 & Multiwave HCI: Cognitive Science

-unflattening the mind

-distributed cognition, 4E, other integrative theory

  

Douglas Englebart:¬†

-demo on how computers could be used to work collaboratively

-mouse (influenced Xerox PARC who Apple stole from who Microsoft stole from)

  

Human Decision Making is Rarely Rational (Chapter 12)

-human decision making is not rational or stable over time

-losses mean more than gains, pain of loss not linear with loss amount

Framing Effect: biased by how choices are worded, makes choices unstable

-biased by imagination/memory,

Availability Heuristic: overestimate probability of improbable events based on easily recallable stories/memories, give more weight to compelling stories than statistical evidence

-system one only considers immediate perceptual information and strong, easy to recall memories

Supporting Rational Decision Making: help people engage system two

1. provide all options
    
2. help people find alternatives
    
3. provide unbiased data
    
4. don‚Äôt make people calculate
    
5. check assertions/assumptions
    

Data Visualization: harnessing system one to support system two

-we can automatically perceive relationships in complex visual data (geographic v. schematic subway may, provide only necessary information)

-employ automatic system one processes for system two

-more memorable if we include recognizable objects

Convincing and Persuading:

-seduce system one and bypass system two

-how information is presented is just as influential as information itself

1. Decision Support System: unbiased, rational comparison and evaluation
    
2. Persuasion System: emotional content, agenda, bias
    

  

Progressive Unflattening for Better Design:

1. Natasha Jen: linear design thinking is BS  
    -need evidence, outcome, critique, deeper reasoning about design
    
2. Science as another way to look at design: creativity + science = unflattening
    
3. Science of colour: unflattening of opponent colour v. trichromacy
    
4. Science of spatial vision: ecological and HIP perspectives unflattened by Marr‚Äôs middle level of algorithm (vision as adaptation to environment and biological machines)
    

Marr:

1. Computational: ecological
    
2. Algorithm: mind processes bridging ecological and mechanism
    
3. Implementation: brain/mechanism
    

5. Unflattening cognitive science and philosophy of perception: last and deepest level
    

-each level is deeper level of thinking about humans in natural, created and virtual environments

  

4Es of Distributed Cognition: Role of Environment in Algorithm Level:

1. Embedded Cognition: we think better in well-structured environments/using representations
    
2. Enactive Cognition: we see patterns, then take action (smart seeing, projecting, representations)
    
3. Embodied Cognition: our actions play a role in thought (framework for understanding)
    
4. Extended Cognition: cognitive systems of humans and artifacts needed to explain how we think
    

  

What is left out of Marr?¬†

-algorithms are influenced by motor performance as well.

-our impression of detailed environments comes from rapid eye movements based on our goal. we see what we want to see

Extending Vision to D-Cog:

Marr:¬†

1. mechanism: brain
    
2. algorithm: mind
    
3. computational: environment
    

D-Cog:

1. mechanisms can be actions (take action to clarify world)
    
2. algorithms can be distributed between brain and environment (representations)
    
3. computational theory
    

Smart-Seeing: actions with eyes and hands to understand the world

Projection: foresee events based on past experience

Close-Coupling: skilled human/artifact interaction, external representations are dynamic, thinking processes must keep up with changes to deal with them effectively

-dual tasking challenges us

-time constraints change strategies

Active Algorithms: manipulating things

1. Mentally manipulate in head
    
2. Physically manipulate in world
    

-choose strategy based on cost-benefit analysis (internal cost, coordinating cost, external cost)

-motor processes are downloaded and embodied cognition becomes higher order processes (abacus)

-understanding logic/visual representation of concepts

Data Visualization: ‚Äúknowledge generators:‚Äù

-some infographics preset POV (persuasive systems)

-some support users to build their own knowledge (decision support systems)

-often user will discover things in visualizations that designer was unaware of

  

AI and Socially-Distributed Cognition:

JCR Lickinder: human brain and computing machines will be couples in partnership to think and process better than either alone

IEEE: ethically aligned design guidelines: only using AI in ways positive to humans

-or design AI to be unable to harm humans by limiting agency, make it need a human counterpart to react to

Close coupling approach: AI system acts as companion, information comes as you need it to facilitate flow

Engelbart: use technology to collaborate and support human brain

-augmented human intelligence (collective IQ)

-co-evolution of artifacts, socio-cultural language practices (humans improve capabilities as systems improve)

Goal: knowledge workers paired with AI, act as reflective practitioners to improve processes

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/iyzxjagVbrCayD7GgieQuQbqkkDiPMEStntQlTXsl1qWdPUu1ayUKVuKFH_qyhFhCv09-bFLCypH07nfdtIYkcZq0ut8PZ0aJz--UnnotvCgruhlL-4Q7N2JSykSWjN3YRWfOv8zR-SIYUMKpl-TaQ)

Summing up the SIAT curriculum:

Creative Design Approach: inherited from design schools

Evidence & Outcomes (Scientific) Approach:uses different evidence based on desired outcome¬†

1. social sciences (social networks)
    
2. vision science (visualization and VR/AR)
    
3. cognitive psychology (learning, healthcare, safety)
    

-different kinds of evidence support different testing of outcomes/critique

Participatory Design Approach: working with complex systems, designing with not for¬†

-we rarely think alone, collaboration is strength, design is a team sport

-new design education means merging art, science, technology, business, all knowledge to work on complex problems

  

Theory of Mind: capacity to perceive and understand others‚Äô mental states

-understanding intentions to understand actions

-we have a need to understand why people do things

Agent: moving objects in world that can act on their own, reacts to interaction partners‚Äô behaviour, they have goals

Imitation: careful observation and replication of behaviours

Mimicry: unintentional, automatic imitation

Synchrony: unconsciously synchronized with interaction partner

Automatic Empathy: unconsciously mimic expression

Joint Attention: awareness of focusing on the same thing

Visual Perspective Taking: awareness that others literally see world different than us

Simulation: using personal mental states as model to understand others‚Äô

Projection: assuming others‚Äô mental states/thinking are identical to ours

  

Psychology of Groups:

Significance of Groups:

-need to belong (happier, more satisfied when in groups)

-affiliation (social comparison)

-identity (self assessment of group = collective self-esteem)

Evolutionary Advantages (our greatest invention):

-motivation/performance

-social facilitation (perform better when competing)

Drawbacks:

-social loafing (coordination loss)

Team Success:

-shared mental model

-group unity

Development:

-forming

-storming

-norming

-performing

-adjourning

Decisions:

-group polarization

-groupthink

-common knowledge affect

  

Social Distributed-Cognition in Design:

User-Engaged Design: shift in design with designers pushing back on harmful design

-obligation to every user not just paying customer

-just aesthetics are not enough to create good designs in a technical world

  

Wave 2 HCI: social science theory applied to information systems for collaborative work (new meaning of technology as social tool)

Ethnography Methods:

1. Social/Anthropology Methods
    

research methods structured to avoid bias¬†

1. understanding context
    
2. avoid interpretation as long as possible
    
3. acknowledge and correct bias
    

goal: understand other cultures‚Äô

1. social relationships
    
2. ways of signaling/signifying
    
3. ways of thinking, values
    
4. use or artifacts
    

1. Observational Research Approach:
    

goal of focused conceptual design from observations

1. what do people actually do?
    
2. how can we support this activity?
    
3. design operations enabling users to easily accomplish goals
    

goal of rich understanding of how users think and live¬†

2. Hutchins: Cognitive Ethnography: ethnographic analysis of cognitive operations distributed across human/non-human actors
    

-many people who understand a part of the process coordinate actions to accomplish task no one alone can do

Cognitive System Includes:

1. scripts, sequences of tasks individuals are trained to do
    
2. artifacts that support the task
    
3. communication protocols/channels of communication
    

-the mind is the thing with knowledge, distributed over people, procedures and

things

  

3. Contextual Inquiry: interviewing in context
    

-designer as apprentice learning from user

Action Research Model: helping/improving as researching

1. context: see workplace/what happens
