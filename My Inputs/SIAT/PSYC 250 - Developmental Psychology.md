## Notes

Chapter 1: Introduction to Developmental Psychology

  

Why Study Developmental Psychology?

1. Raising Children
    
2. Policies
    
3. Understanding Human Nature
    

  

Themes:

1. Nature and Nurture (interplay)
    

Nature: biological endowment

Nurture: social/physical/environmental influence

2. The Active Child (children shape own environment)
    
3. Continuity/Discontinuity
    

Continuity: age-related gradual change

Discontinuity: age-related large shift

Stage Theories: development is progression of age-related qualitative shifts

4. Mechanisms of Change
    

Variation: differences of thought/behaviour

Selection: more frequent survival/reproduction of organisms well adapted to environment

5. Sociocultural Context
    

Sociocultural: physical, social, cultural, historical, economic influence

6. Individual Differences
    

Individual Differences: genetic, parental treatment, choices, reactions

7. Research and Child’s Welfare (diagnosing/helping overcome problems)
    

  

Methods for Studying Child Development:

1. Scientific Method: beliefs are untrue until tested 
    

1. Choose question to answer
    
2. Formulate hypothesis
    
3. Develop method to test it
    
4. Use data to draw conclusion
    

Reliability: consistency of independent measures

Interrater: do different people identify the same events/behaviours?

Test-Retest: replicable results

Validity: does it measure what it intends to measure?

Internal: is the result really due to variables of study?

External: are results generalizable?

2. Gathering Data
    

Interviews (structured, unstructured, clinical)

Observation (naturalistic, structured)

Experiments

3. Correlational Designs: establish relation of variables
    

Direction-of-Causation Problem: what variable is cause and what is effect?

Third Variable Problem: correlation may be result of third variable

4. Experimental Designs
    

Experiment: to establish cause and effect

-needs random assignment, experimental control, inference about cause/effect

1. Cross-Sectional: different ages compared over short period
    
2. Longitudinal: sane children studied over long period
    
3. Microgenetic: same children studied over short period
    

  

Nativism: evolution provides built-in world understanding 

Empiricism: infants haver special capacity to learn but no built-in knowledge

Genome: complete set of hereditary information

Epigenetics: changes in gene expression from environmental causes

Methylation: biochemical process that suppresses gene expression, changes behaviour

Neurotransmitters: chemicals involved in brain cell communication

Cumulative Risk: all disadvantages of development compounded

  

Chapter 2: Prenatal Development and the Newborn Period

  

Epigenesis: emergence of new structures/functions in course of development

  

Conception:

Gametes: reproductive cells (sperm and egg), ½ the genetic information of other cells

Meiosis: cell division that produces gametes

Conception: union of egg and sperm

Zygote: fertilized egg

Embryo: 3rd - 8th week

Fetus: 9th week to birth

Developmental Processes: from Zygote to Fetus

1. Mitosis
    
2. Cell Migration
    
3. Cell Differentiation
    

Embryonic Stem Cell: can become any cell

4. Apoptosis: genetically programmed cell death
    

Androgens: class of hormones including Testosterone that lead to development of male genitals

  

Early Development:

-4th day become hollow sphere with cell inner cell mass on one side, inner cell mass becomes 3 layers:

1. Top Layer: nervous system, nails, teeth, inner ear, lens of eye, skin surface
    
2. Middle Layer: muscle, bone, circulatory system, inner skin layer, organs
    
3. Bottom Layer: digestive system, lungs, urinary tract, glands
    

Neural Tube: groove at top layer of embryo’s differentiated cells that becomes spinal cord and brain

Amniotic Sac: membrane full of fluid where fetus floats

Placenta: blood vessels connecting mother and fetus, semipermeable (allows transfer of things carried in bloodstream, not blood)

Umbilical Cord: tube connecting amniotic sac to placenta

Cephalocaudal Development: had develops first, farthest from head last

Identical (Monozygotic) Twins: form at this stage when inner cell mass splits

Fraternal (Dizygotic) Twins: form from 2 eggs and 2 sperm

  

Fetal Experience/Behaviour:

Movement:

-5-6 weeks starts to move

-7 weeks has hiccups

-swallowing, fetal breathing (sucking in amniotic fluid)

Sight:

-3rd trimester can process visual information

Taste:

-mother’s food taste transferred through amniotic fluid

-like sweet amniotic fluid better

Smell:

-can smell foods from amniotic fluid

Phylogenetic Community: humans share developmental characteristics with animals (mammals) due to common evolutionary history

Hearing:

-very noisy (heartbeat, breathing, digestion)

-heart rate changes when mother speaks (prefer mother’s voice over others)

-prenatal learning plays role in auditory cortex development

  

Fetal Learning:

-prefer language/foods experienced in womb

Habituation: decreased response when stimuli repeated

Dishabituation: increased response when shown new stimuli

Studying What the Fetus Knows Prenatally:

1. Prenatal Studies:
    

Ultrasound Techniques: expose to stimuli prenatally, measure response as newborn

2. Newborn Studies
    

Habituation: decreased response when repeated stimuli

Boredom: loss of attention/movement

-fetus activity differs between depressed/non-depressed mothers (less blood flow/movement at 5-7 months)

Violation-of-Expectations: possible/impossible events

-measure with looking time, look longer at impossible events

Preferential Looking: look longer at impossible, interesting, surprising events

-recognize rhymes/stories presented before birth

-prefer smell/taste/sound patterns of prenatal experience at birth

-remember scent of amniotic fluid

  
  

Hazards to Prenatal Development:

Teratogens: external agent that can cause damage/death during prenatal development

Sensitive Period: time when most at risk of teratogen impacts

1-8 weeks: structural sensitive period

12-38 weeks: physiological sensitive period

Dose-Response Relation: more exposure increases risk of impacts

Sleeper Effects: delayed consequences

Fetal Programming: prenatal experience that dictates set points in adulthood

1. Drugs: legal and illegal are dangerous
    
2. Antidepressants: inconclusive if dangerous
    
3. Opioids: fetus becomes addicted, impacts brain development
    
4. Cannabis: harmful for memory, attention, learning
    
5. Cigarettes: SIDS, low birth weight, lower IQ, hearing deficits, ADHD, cancer
    

-ecigarettes are also dangerous for large amount of nicotine (cardiac, respiratory, nervous system impacts)

6. Alcohol: leading cause of fetal brain injury. 
    

-fetus gets alcohol directly by blood and through amniotic fluid, stays in system much longer than mother’s

Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD): continuum of harmful effects

Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS): when baby got most harmful effects (facial deformities, intellectual disability, attention/hyperactivity problems)

7. Environmental Pollutants: heavy metals, air pollution, water
    

Maternal Factors:

1. Age: older = autism risk
    
2. Nutrition: prematurely aged brain, attention issues (folic acid to prevent spina bifida)
    
3. Disease: rubella, STIs, HIV, Zika
    
4. Emotional State: prenatal stress = antisocial baby, postnatal stress = anxious baby
    

  

Birth Experience:

-38 weeks baby’s lungs release a protein that induces labour

-baby squeezed to shrink head, remove fluid from lungs, withstand oxygen deprivation

Birth Practices: vary by culture, all have 2 things in common:

1. Guarding survival/health of mom and baby
    
2. Ensuring social integration of new person
    

C-Section: if birth complications, prior c-section, scheduling convenience, obesity, multiple births

  

Newborn Infant: 

State of Arousal: level of arousal/engagement (sleep to play)

Sleep:

-newborns sleep 2x more than young adults

-patterns of sleep change with age

Rapid-Eye-Movement: active sleep state (dreaming), jerky eye/body movement, irregular heartbeat/breathing (50% of newborn sleep time, 20% by 3-4 years)

-allows infant to develop visual/motor skill

Non-REM Sleep: quiet sleep state, slow breathing/heartbeat, brainwaves 

Crying:

-normal, increases until peak at 6-8 weeks, decreases at 3-4 months

Soothing: moderately intense and continuous/repetitive stimulation

Swaddling: wrapping tightly

Colic: excessive, uncontrollable crying for no reason (may be allergy to milk, gut issues, gas)

Reflexes: involuntary response

Bonding:

Synchrony: parental attunement to baby’s state

-hormone changes increase buturing behaviours

Temperament: individual/group differences

-different cultures have different temperaments

  

Negative Outcomes at Birth:

Apgar Score: assesses health of newborn baby (skin tone, pulse rate, facial response, limb activity, breathing)

Infant Mortality: rare in industrialized world

-higher in territories (poverty, macrosomic births (big babies), limited healthcare access

Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS): sudden unexpected death of infant less than one with no obvious cause

-possibly caused by brain stem abnormalities, don’t wake up when too hot/can’t breathe

Reduce Risk:

-sleep on back

-no smoking

-firm bedding

-not too warm

-breastfeed

Low Birth Weight (LBW): > 2500 grams, full term

-higher development problems (academic, sensory, behavioural), white matter reduction, ventricular enlargement, abnormal brain development

Premature: born 37 or less weeks

Small for Gestational Age: weigh less than normal baby at same stage

-can lead to more medical issues, can be caused by multiple births

Developmental Resilience: successful development despite multiple developmental hazards

-all risks compound (no one thing screws you up)

  

Week 3: Biology and Behaviour

  

Nature and Nurture:

-can only understand relative contribution of each, always intertwined, overlapping, influencing each other

-humans have 20,000-21,000 protein coding genes (most shared by all living things, genes 1% of genome, rest regulates activity of protein coding genes

Genome: complete set of DNA of an organism including all genes

Gene Synthesis: producing DNA (changing genomes for medical reasons)

Genotype: inherited genetic material

Phenotype: observable genotype expression (physical and behavioural)

1. Parent’s Genotype - Child’s Genotype
    

-genetic material from parents passed down in DNA

Chromosomes: molecules of DNA that transmit genetic information

-46 chromosomes, 23 pairs in each cell nucleus

DNA: molecules that carry all biochemical instructions for life

Genes: sections of chromosomes, basic unit of heredity, code for particular process, guarantee similarity and difference at species and individual level

Random Assortment: in formation of egg/sperm

Crossing Over: members of chromosome pair swap over when gametes divide

Mutation: change in DNA caused by error or environment (inherited disorders), favourable genes proliferate

Sex Determination: sex chromosomes determine sex of individual (XX or XY)

-male parent determines sex of offspring (does he bring X or Y?)

2. Child’s Genotype - Child Phenotype
    

-genes expressed as phenotype (personality and physical characteristics) depending on environment

Endophenotypes: intermediate phenotypes (brain, nervous system) that mediate pathways between genes and behaviour

Regulator Genes: controls activity of other genes (when on or off, chain of events)

Dominance Patterns: ⅓ of human genes have 2+ forms (alleles)

Allele: 2+ different forms of gene

Dominant Allele: expressed if present

Recessive Allele: expressed if dominant not present

Homozygous: 2 of same allele

Heterozygous: 2 different allele

-2 X chromosome: dominant expressed, XY: recessive expressed (leads to sex-linked disorders in men)

Polygenic Inheritance: many genes contribute to phenotype

3. Child’s Environment - Child Phenotype
    

-environment influences phenotypic expression (switching on/off of genes)

-parents behaviour also genetically influenced (influences environment they create) so even non-genetically-transmitted alleles have impact (genetic nurture)

Phenylketonuria (PKU): cannot metabolize phenylalanine (amino acid) due to recessive gene on chromosome 12

-no exposure, no effect (red meat, aspartame) no developmental/intellectual disabilities

-exposure, effect it builds up in blood and impairs brain development and intelligence

Testing: used to determine if parents carry specific disorders

Prenatal Testing: genetic testing during pregnancy to assess fetus risk for genetic disorders

Newborn Screening: tests to screen infants for genetic/non-genetic disorders

4. Child Phenotype - Child’s Environment
    

-characteristics change what environments you choose to exist in

-child not blank slate, evoke response from others, have preferences/autonomy

-how child acts influences how others react/ how environment is formed

5. Child’s Environment - Child’s Genotype
    

Epigenetics: environmental experience turns genes on/off (neglect = anxiety/avoidance), can be inherited (cross-generational transmission of stress)

Methylation: silences gene expression

  

Brain Development:

-tells us a lot about genetic/environmental factors

Neuron:

Neuron: basic unit of brains information system (gray matter)

3 components:

1. Cell Body: basic biological material to keep neuron running
    
2. Dendrites: fibers that receive input from other cells, conduct towards cell body with electrical impulses
    
3. Axon: fiber that conducts electrical signals from cell body to neurons
    

Synapses: junction between axon of one neuron/dendrite branches of another

Glial Cells: for myelin sheath, for scaffolding for neurons to travel along

Myelin Sheath: fatty substance around axons to increase speed/efficiency of information transmission

Cortex:

-lobes perform different general functions (all areas involved)

Cerebral Cortex (gray matter): 80% of brain, 4 lobes

1. Frontal Lobe: executive functioning (cognitive/inhibitory control, planning, decision making, working memory)
    
2. Parietal Lobe: spatial processing, integration of information from senses
    
3. Occipital Lobe: visual processing
    
4. Temporal Lobe: memory, speech, language, emotion, auditory information
    

Association Areas: information from multiple sensory systems processes here, between major sensory/motor areas

Cerebral Hemispheres: 2 halves of cortex (opposite control)

Corpus Callosum: dense connective nerves that connect hemispheres for communication

Cerebral Lateralization: hemispheres specialized for different modes of processing

  

Studying Brain Development:

fMRI: magnet detects cerebral blood flow while showing stimulus(increased blood flow = increased activity)

ERPs (Event Related Potentials): electroencephalographic (EEG) recording of electrical activity in brain while responding to stimuli

  

Developmental Processes:

Neurogenesis: proliferation of neurons through cell division (starts 42 days after conception), dramatic increase in neurons in prenatal development (4-18 weeks)

-make new neurons into adulthood

Arborization: formation of new dendritic trees/branches

Spines: formations on dendrites that increase connection forming capacity

Myelination: formation of myelin sheath around axons to speed up information processing

-myelinated axons = white matter below cell bodies (gray matter) on surface

Synaptogenesis: when neurons make connections to other neurons 

Synaptic Pruning: use it or lose it, some connections are severed

-happens at specific stages in development

-Autism: larger brain, reduced pruning in childhood

-Schizophrenia: excessive pruning in adolescence

Plasticity: capacity for brain to be molded by experience (allows less gene encoding, more adaptation)

Experience-Expectant Plasticity: general human experience expected (sight, gravity, others, love) and needed to develop (otherwise deprived and do not develop normally)

-fewer genes dedicated to normal development but heightened vulnerability

Cross-Modal Reorganization: that part of brain will process something else

Experience-Dependent Plasticity: use it or lose it, neural connections created and reorganized through life are function of experience

-windows for development close if don’t get certain stimuli in time, can’t be made up

-animals raised in enriched environments perform better (more complex environment = more neural connections)

Visual: 6-10 months lose ability to process certain visual stimuli if not exposed to it

Auditory: 

6 months: able to tell difference between sounds in all languages

10 months: only able to tell difference in native language sounds

-because of synaptic pruning

  

Brain Damage and Recovery:

Worst time: during neurogenesis, neural migration (prenatal and 1 year after birth)

Best time: greatest plasticity, when synaptic pruning occurring in childhood (2-4 years)

  

Behaviour Genetics:

1. Genotypic similarity should equal phenotypic similarity
    
2. Reared together should be more similar than reared apart
    

Behaviour Genetics: science of how variation in development/behaviour results from genetic and environmental factors

Heritable: estimate of proportion of trait variance among population attributes to genetic differences (only applicable at population level)

Quantitative Genetics Research Designs:

Family Studies: knowing relatedness allows us to estimate genetic influence

-determines if phenotype traits are correlated with degree of relation

Twin Studies: concordance between identical and fraternal twins compared to see if genetic factors account for traits

Concordance: degree of similarity among twins

Equal Environments Assumption: twins growing up together have same environment (overly simplistic)

Adoption Study: checks if traits are genetic or social

Molecular Genetics Research Designs:

DNA Variation: behavioural variation

Genome-Wide Association Studies: link multiple DNA segments with traits (many genes = each trait)

Genome-Wide Complex Trait Analysis: deconstructs genetic/environmental effects compounded in families

Environmental Effects: examination of genes' effect on behaviour/development. Also examination of environmental influence. 

-even within family environment is different

-much harder to measure than genes

  

Growth and Maturation:

-from birth to 20 years you become 15-20x heavier and 3x taller

-head is 50% of body length at 2 months, 10% in adulthood

Variability: genes effect growth/sexual maturation

Secular Trends: changes in physical development over generations (people are generally taller now)

  

Nutritional Behaviour/Health:

Infant Feeding:

-breast milks is free of bacteria, strengthens immune system, antibodies, reduces woman’s risk of breast/overian cancer, higher IQ (fatty acids), increased myelination

Food Preferences:

-all like sweet/savoury (poison often sour/bitter)

Food Nephobia: wont eat unfamiliar foods

-using food as reward = higher obesity rates

Obesity:

-most common dietary problem is overeating

-weight is genetic (correlated to biological parents more than adoptive)

-difficult temperament = gain weight faster, less impulse control, higher BMI

-less sleep/screens = predictors of obesity

Undernutrition: increases risk of infection, reduces nutrient absorption

-vaccines prevent 2-3 million deaths a year

  

Week 4: Theories of Cognitive Development

  

Cognitive Development: perception, attention, reason, problem-solving, language, memory, conceptual understanding, intelligence

Social Development: emotions, personality, relationships, self-understanding, aggression, moral behaviour

Why are theories important?

1. ground research by providing framework
    
2. drive new empirical research
    
3. raise crucial questions about human nature
    

  

1. Piaget’s Theory (little scientists)
    

-babies are mentally active from birth, intrinsically motivated to learn, mental/physical activity influences development

Constructivist: construct knowledge based on experience(like scientific method)

1. generating hypothesis
    
2. performing experiments
    
3. drawing conclusions
    

  

Central Development Issues:

1. Nature/Nurture
    

Nurture: every experience

Nature: brain, body, processing (how to respond to nurture)

Adaptation: respond to environmental demands to meet goals

Organization: integrate observations into coherent knowledge

2. Sources of Continuity
    

1. Assimilation: incorporate information into existing concept
    
2. Accomodation: adding information to expand a concept
    
3. Equilibration: balance these for stable understanding 
    

Equilibrium: satisfied understanding

Disequilibrium: realize don’t fully understand when new info added

Advanced Equilibrium: applied to broader range of scenarios

3. Sources of Discontinuity
    

Stage Theory Properties:

1. Qualitative Change
    
2. Broad Applicability
    
3. Brief Transition
    
4. Invariant Sequence
    

  

Piaget’s Stage Theory:

  

1. Sensorimotor Period (birth - 2 years)
    

-intelligence gained/expressed through sensory/motor ability

-living in present, immediate perception

-accommodate actions to preferred outcome (sucking), integrate reflexes

Object Permanence: understanding that objects continue to exist when out of sight (develops late 1st year)

A not B error: reach for where remember object being, not where saw be hidden (8-12 months)

-exploring use of objects (1 year)

-enduring mental representations (18-24 months)

Deferred Imitation: repeating others’ behaviour long after it has occured

  

2. Preoperational Period (2-7 years)
    

-language/mental imagery to represent experience

-inability to perform certain mental operations (with multiple dimensions)

Symbolic Representation: use of object/thought/word to stand for another (3-5 years)

Egocentrism: only seeing world from your POV

Centration: focus on one feature of object/event

Observation Concept: changing appearance does not change other properties

  

3. Concrete Operational Period (7-12 years)
    

-reason logically about concrete objects/events 

-cannot think purely abstract or generate systematic experiments 

  

4. Formal Operational (12+ years)
    

-abstract/hypothetical thought, can make systematic experiments

-not universal

-if reaches allows to consider different perspectives/possibilities

  

Piaget Issues:

1. vague about mechanisms of changing thinking/cognitive growth
    
2. infant and children are more cognitively competent than Piaget thought
    
3. understates social world contribution on learning (only focuses on self contribution)
    
4. stage model depicts child thinking as consistent (it’s not)
    

  

2. Information-Processing Theories (task analysis)
    

-focus on structure of cognitive system/mental activities used to deploy attention and memory to solve problems

-emphasis on thinking as process occurring over time

-specifications of thinking processes (specific mental abilities over time)

-structure of cognitive system

Task Analysis: specifying goals, obstacles, solutions in problem solving

Computer Simulation: mathematical model expressing ideas about mental processes

  

View of Children’s Nature:

-cognitive development occurring continuously in incremental growth 

1. Child as Limited-Capacity Processing System: 
    

-through learning/brain structure maturation children increase amount of data processed at once, acquire new strategies and knowledge

2. Child as Problem-Solver:
    

-child as active participant in development

-cognitive flexibility helps children to achieve goals

Problem Solving: attaining a goal using strategy to overcome obstacles

  

Central Development Issues:

Memory Development:

Working Memory: actively attending to, maintaining, processing information

-limited in time maintained and capacity

Long-Term Memory: knowledge accumulated over lifetime

-factual, procedural, attitudes

-unlimited info for unlimited time

Executive Functioning: control behaviour/thought processes

Explanations of Memory Development:

1. Basic Processes: simplest, most frequently used mental activities
    

Encoding: remembering specifics of events considered important

-processing speed also plays role (myelination, increased brain connectivity)

2. Strategies: major source of memory development
    

Rehearsal: repetition of information to help remember

Selective Attention: focus on information relevant to current goal

3. Content Knowledge: increased knowledge improves learning and recall 
    

-more interesting/important so encode (specific topics)

  

Development of Problem Solving 

Overlapping Waves Theory: use many approaches to solve problems, strategies that work are repeated, strategies that don’t aren’t (simplest to most complex)

Planning: problem solving most effective if plan before act

-difficult, requires inhibiting immediate action impulse

-children are overly optimistic about abilities

  

3. Core-Knowledge Theories: children have some innate knowledge in domains of evolutionary importance and learning mechanisms for rapidly/effortlessly acquiring additional information in those domains
    

  

Views of Children's Nature:

-active learners, well-adapted product of evolution

Domain Specific: information about a specific content area

  

Central Development Issues:

1. Nativism: born with knowledge in evolutionarily important domains
    

-4 systems with own principles (inanimate objects, minds/goals/actions of others, numbers, spatial layout/geometric relations)

Language Acquisition Device: enables young children to understand grammar quickly/easily

2. Constructivism: combine rudimentary innate knowledge with learned experience (specialized learning ability) 
    

-organize understanding into theories (physics, psychology, biology)

  

4. Sociocultural Theories (social creatures): emphasize other person/cultural contribution to  development, cognitive development takes place through social interaction
    

Guided Participation: more knowledgeable individual organized activity so less knowledgeable can learn (perform at higher level than they could alone)

Social Scaffolding: more competent people provide temporary framework that supports child to think at higher level than alone

Cultural Tools: products of human ingenuity that enhance thinking  (symbols, objects, skills, values)

Views of Child's Nature: Vygotsky’s Theory:

-social learners, others help us gain skills.understanding

-gradual, continuous change

-language/thought connection

Stages in Behaviour Regulation:

1. Controlled by others
    
2. Controlled by private speech 
    

Private Speech: tell themselves aloud what to do, imitating parents

3. Controlled by internalized private speech (whisper, internal)
    

-adults use private speech for difficult/unfamiliar tasks

Children as Teachers and Learners:

Teaching: crucial to ability to build culture, humans have unique characteristics crucial to ability to build complex, dynamically changing cultures

-only humans engage in intentional teaching not tied to tangible goals

Children as Products of Their Culture:

-processes of learning are the same across cultures, content learned is different

  

Central Development Issues: 

-how change occurs though social interaction

Zone of Proximal Development: range of performance between alone and with support

Intersubjectivity: mutual understanding people share during communication (meeting of minds), foundation of human cognitive development, basis for joint attention

Joint Attention: social partners focus on same thing in external environment, allows to learn from others

  

5. Dynamic-Systems Theories (the whole): 
    

-how change occurs over time in complex systems

-dynamic, all point in development are transitions

-newest theory

-relations among motor activities, attention, other aspects of children’s behaviour

  

View of Children’s Nature:

-internally motivated to learn to understand world/expand capabilities

Centrality of Action: actions shape development 

  

Central Development Issues:

Self Organization: development is process of integrating to adapt 

  

Mechanisms of Change: 

-change occurs through variation (different behaviours used for same goal)

-relative success of each approach, efficiency, novelty

-cognitive development of abilities emerge with development of motor capabilities (how one system’s development impacts other systems)

  

Week 5: Perception, Action and Learning in Infancy

  

Perception & Cognition:

Outcomes:

-details/evidence for perceptual development (vision, auditory, touch, taste, smell, intermodal)

-know evidence for infant object, social, physical knowledge, theoretical perspectives on evidence

  

Sensation: processing stimuli with sense organs

Perception: interpreting sensory information

  

Vision: 

Preferential-Looking Technique: showing two stimuli to see if can differentiate between or prefer one, rather look at something than nothing

Habituation: bored after repeated exposure to same stimuli

  

Visual Acuity/Colour Perception:

Visual Acuity: how sharp/clear vision is

Contrast-Sensitivity: ability to detect difference in light/dark areas in visual pattern (babies have poor contrast-sensitivity due to immature cones)

Cone Cells: light sensitive neurons concentrated in fovea

1 month: can’t see difference between black and white and colour

2 months: can see colours, prefer pure colours, perceive colour differences before learned categories

  
  

Visual Scanning:

Smooth-Pursuit Eye Movement: gaze shifts at same rate as moving object (developed due to maturation)

1 month: look at face outline

2 months: look at outline and details

4 months: fixate on eyes

babbling: fixate on mouth

-humans are experts in faces because of practice, develop face categories in infancy (prefer mom over stranger within 12 hours, prefer attractive, prefer face-like configuration)

  

Object Perception:

Perceptual Constancy: perception of constant shape/size/colour in spite of visual differences

Object Segregation: perception of boundaries between objects

  

Object Knowledge:

-more object permanence than Piaget thought 

Violation-of-Expectancy (VOE): event makes infant surprised/interested if goes against expectations

  

Depth Perception:

Optical Expansion: object occludes more of background as comes closer

Binocular Disparity: difference in eye placement results in slightly different image in each eye (perception of 3 dimensions)

Stereopsis: visual cortex combines 2 eye signals resulting in depth perception

Monocular Depth Cues/Pictorial Cues: depth cues one eye can perceive

  

Auditory Perception:

-auditory system more developed at birth than visual system

  

Auditory Localization: perception of spatial location of sound source (turn towards sounds)

Music Perception:

-singing to infants very common

Melodic Perception: infants make perceptual discriminations adults can’t (don’t have understanding yet so listen to all aspects)

Perceptual Narrowing: experience fine tunes perception

  

Taste and Smell:

-exposure to bitter before 6 months increases likelihood of later preference

-prenatal exposure to tastes more influential than exposure through breast milk

  

Touch:

-start with mouth, than motor development to form mental map of own body

  

Intermodal Perception: combining information from 2+ sensory systems

-humans are very good at this

1mo can detect tactile and visual delay

4 mo can detect audio and visual delay

  

Cognition: thinking processes, making sense of world

-research organized by what babies know:

1. knowledge of social world
    

-social expectations based on experience

-prefer style of mother’s response (slow or fast)

Social Smile: (8 weeks, as early as 4.5-5 weeks) smile in response to social interaction

Ed Tronick Still Face Experiment: stop interacting and see how baby reacts (protests, panics), when interact again happy (takes a bit to warm up), prefer social interaction

-understand/infer intentions of others

-surprised when others reach for something unusual (out of character)

-understand others preferences are distinct from their own

Hamlin, Wynn Bloom Studies: 6 and 10 mos social evaluation, understanding of good/bad based on actions

Barett, Broesch et al Studies: theory of mind, what sort of social expectations do babies have in the world? Show them scene where someone has false belief, but babies know truth. Before 4 yrs think they will look where they think it is. Infants can pass some parts of broken down test.

1. knowledge of physical world
    
2. knowledge of objects
    

  

Motor Development:

Outcomes:

theoretical perspectives, empirical evidence to support them

  

-experience predicts development (relearn perceptual skills with each stage of motor development)

  

Early Theories: due to neurological maturity

Current Theories: dynamic-systems approach (neural mechanisms, strength, posture control, balance, perceptual skills, motivation)

  

-baby movements jerky because experiencing full gravity for the first time

-some cultures do stretches with babies to speed up motor development

  

Reflexes:

Reflex: fixed pattern of action in response to particular situation

1. Grasping: close fingers when palm pressed
    
2. Rooting: turn head/open mouth in direction of touch
    
3. Sucking/Swallowing: response to roof of mouth stimulation
    
4. Tonic Neck: head turned to one side, arm/knee on other side flex
    
5. Moro: throwing back head/arms rapidly then drawing in when frightened
    
6. Stepping: stepping when held upright and feet on solid surface
    

Affordances: possibilities for action offered/permited by object/situation

  

Expanding World of Infant:

Reaching (3-4 months):

-bring the world to them, increases visual/motor development

Pre-Reaching Movements: clumsy swiping at objects

Self-Locomotion (8 months):

-start with belly crawling, walking (11-12 months)

Scale Errors: attempt to perform action with miniature object

Grasp Error: attempt to reach into/grasp 2D image of object

Media Errors: attempt to pass/receive object through screen

  

Karen Adolph Studies: how experience changes ability, affordances shape ability, with motor abilities come cognitive, perceptual, motor abilities

Campos Studies: Visual Cliff, new crawler will go right over, experienced crawler will hesitate. Go over if encouraged by parent, don’t if adult says no.

-uncertain, look to adult for what to do

  

Learning and Memory:

Outcomes:

-understand kinds of learning mechanisms, how they are studied (and know studies), empirical evidence

  

Kinds of Learning:

1. Habituation
    

-adaptive: allows to focus on new stimuli

-speed of habituation reflects greater cognitive efficiency/ability (higher IQ)

2. Perceptual Learning
    

-foundation for other kinds of learning, understanding perception

Differentiation: extracting regularities from constantly changing environment, detecting correlations (emotional face expression, tone)

Affordances: presenting an opportunity for action (develop more if more affordance of development)

Active Learning: learn from engaging with world better than watching it

3. Statistical Learning
    

-using environmental information to detect statistically predictable patterns, regularities in events, probabilities, contingencies

Rovee-Collier Study: age related changes between infant behaviour (kicking) and external event (moving mobile), found infants want to predict and control their experience, have impact on the world

4. Observational Learning
    

Imitation: copying behaviour regardless of end result, central to early learning

Emulation: get to same end result but skip behaviours leading up

Meltzoff Studies: newborns imitate tongue protrusions 

-pay attention to adults’ reasoning, intention (18mo will execute desired action not actual executed action), who is performing action

-study range of ages to see when imitation changes

Current Research: neural underpinnings of imitative learning, mirror neuron system in nonhuman primates (may be present in infant brain)

Mirror Neurons: vicarious neuron firing when watching other perform action (as if we are about to do it)

5. Rational Learning
    

-using experience, beliefs, biases to predict future

-forming expectations about how people will respond to them

Xu and Garcia Study: ball colour predictions, 8 mos have grasp of colour distribution probabilities (look longer)

6. Classical Conditioning
    

-associating neutral stimulus to stimulus evoking response

Unconditioned Stimulus: evokes reflexive response

Unconditioned Response: reflexive response to unconditioned stimulus

Conditioned Stimulus: repeatedly occurs before UCS

Conditioned Response: triggered by CS, now starts at UCS

7. Instrumental/Operant Conditioning 
    

-learning relation between own behaviour and consequences

Positive Reinforcement: reward reliably following a behaviour

  

Week 6: Development of Language and Symbol Use

Symbols: systems for representing thoughts, feelings, knowledge, communicating with other people

  

Language Development:

Comprehension: understanding what others say

Language Production: process of speaking/signing/writing (understand more than can say)

Components of Language:

-frees us from the present (can speak about past, present, future ideas)

-species-specific, species-universal

-unmatched in other species (can’t combine words to make generative language)

Generative: finite words combined in infinite sentences (if not generative not language)

Phonemes: smallest units of meaningful sound

Morphemes: smallest units of meaning in language

Syntax: rules specifying how categories of words can be combined

Pragmatics: knowledge about how language is used

Language Requirements:

1. Human Brain
    

Symbols: capacity that sets humans apart

1. represent thoughts, feelings, knowledge
    
2. communicating these to others
    

Symbolic Capacity: creative and flexible

-language is species-specific and species-universal

-animals communicate in less complex/syntax-driven way

Brain-Language Lateralization: left hemisphere is where language is represented and controlled

Sensitive Period: easiest at younger age, ends 5 to puberty

-other areas of young brain take over language development if needed (not the case in adults)

-leaning 2nd language after puberty uses different neural mechanisms than if learned in infancy

Why?

-less motivated to learn, smaller working memory in infancy helps to store chunks of words

2. Human Environment
    

-exposed to other people using the language (verbal or signed) (infants prefer listening to speech than non-vocalization sounds)

Infant-Directed Speech: distinctive mode of speech used when talking to infants existent in most cultures

Characteristics: greater pitch variability, slower speed, shorter utterances, more repetition/questions, exaggerated facial expressions

-conveys information even if infant doesn’t know meaning of words (mood)

-helps infants learn better (more engaged), they prefer it

  

-comprehension precedes production, progression of expertise from

1. Sounds (phonemes)
    
2. Words
    
3. Sentences
    
4. Narratives
    

-speaking is continuous sound, can parse words, hear sound combinations, detect regularities/probabilities

6-10 months:

-decrease in ability to discriminate certain sounds, become expert in pohonemes of native language and lose ability for unfamiliar language sound discrimination (perceptual narrowing, synaptic pruning)

Language: communication system understood and agreed on by members of a community

-conventional sounds, symbols, marks for communication

-formal system of sounds/symbols

  

Critical Debates:

-language learning “mechanism” specific to language or general cognitive development?

-do animals have language? (no)

-critical period for language learning? (1st years)

-is language localized in brain? (yes, hemispheric specialization)

  

Process of Language Acquisition:

Speech Perception:

Prosody: characteristic rhythm/intonational patterns with which language is spoken (how infants recognize native language)

Categorical Perception of Speech Sounds:

Categorical Perception: perception of phonemes as belonging to discrete categories

Voice Onset Time (VOT): amount of time between air passing through lips and vocal cords vibrating

-infants make more distinctions than adults, can discriminate between any language speech sounds (c and k for example)

Developmental Changes in Speech Perception:

-perceptual narrowing by 12 months, result of active learning

Word Segmentation:

Word Segmentation: discovering where one word ends and the next begins in fluent speech (begins 2nd half of first year)

Distributional Properties: certain sounds are more likely to occur together than others in any language

-recognize own name by 4.5 months

Preparation for Speech Production:

Babbling (6-10 months):

Babbling: repetitive consonant-vowel sequences, babies who sign babble in ASL, similar to language most exposed to, signal child is ready to learn language

-learning to take turns speaking and listening

First Words:

-1st word between 10-15 months

First Word: any specific sound consistently used to convey meaning

-shorten complex words

-similar 1st words across cultures, infants have similar interests/priorities

Overextension: overly broad interpretation of a word’s meaning

Underextension: overly narrow interpretation of word’s meaning

Word Learning:

-accelerates at 18 months

1. Adult Influences:
    

-talking to children, using IDS, repeating new words, playing naming games, consistency of environment

2. Child Contributions (Assumptions):
    

Mutual Exclusivity: object has only one name

Whole-Object Assumption: expect new word to refer to whole object not just part

Pragmatic Cues: aspects of social context used for word learning

-use adult’s gaze/emotional response, grammar, shape of object as context for deducing meaning

Cross-Situational Word Learning: determining word meaning by tracking correlations between labels/meanings across contexts

Syntactic Bootstrapping: using grammatical structure to infer meaning of new word

Putting Words Together:

-this distinguishes children’s language learning from other animals

-first sentences at end of second year, understand sentences much earlier than can produce them

Telegraphic Speech: short sentences leaving out non-essential words (just action words)

Grammar: Building New Words and Sentences:

-generative

-generalization (s, ed)

Overregularization: treat irregular forms of words as if they were regular

-parents correct factual errors more than grammar errors

Conversation Skills:

-speech often directed to self, not another person

Collective Monologue (Piaget): conversation between children involving series of non sequiturs

Narrative: story-like descriptions of past events

Pragmatic Development: crucial aspect of conversation, understanding how language is used to communicate

  

Theoretical Issues in Language Development:

Chomsky and Nativist View:

Behaviourism (Skinner): development is function of learning through reinforcement and punishment of overt behaviour

Chomsky counters Skinner:

-generative

-children produce words never heard

-children know structure of language despite not being taught

Universal Grammar: hardwired principles governing grammar in all languages, nativist reason for why humans learn language and animals don’t

Ongoing Debates in Language Development:

1. Degree to which explanation lies in nature or nurture
    

Social Interaction View: all language development influenced by communicative function

Behaviourist View: sounds infants babble can be influenced by parental reinforcement

2. Are cognitive/neural mechanisms domain specific (only for language) or domain general (for all kinds of learning)?
    

Chomsky: highly specific

-general structures for learning details (music, visual shapes, human actions)

Connectionism: computational modelling emphasizing simultaneous activity of numerous interconnected processing units

  

Nonlinguistic Symbol Development:

Using Symbols as Information:

Dual Representation: treating symbolic artifact as real object and as symbol of something other than itself

-children struggle with considering multiple dimensions

-particularly difficult with self-representing symbols

Drawing and Writing:

-3-4 years start trying to draw something from life (if exposed to many pictorial images start earlier)

-struggle to plan for representation of complex spatial relationships

  
  

Week 8: Social Development (Chapter 9)

  

1. Psychoanalytic Theories
    

-development driven by biological maturation, sexual drives motivating behaviour

-emphasis on lifelong impact of early relationships (believe they define individual, now we know they can be resolved but it takes work)

1. Freud: Theory of Psychosexual Development
    

Erogenous Zones: areas of body erotically sensitive in stages of development

-conflicts relating to zones at each stage, failure to resolve impacts development through life and causes fixations

Developmental Process:

1. Oral Stage (1st year): primary gratification is sucking and eating
    

Id: earliest, most primitive part of personality, pleasure principle, unconscious

Ego: second personality component to develop, rational, resolving conflicts between id and real world constraints

2. Anal Stage (2 - 3): control over bodily processes, conflict of delayed gratification (holding it)
    
3. Phallic Stage (3 - 6 years): curious about genitals, identify with same-sex caregiver which gives rise to gender differences
    

Superego: third personality structure to develop, internalized social standards and conscience

4. Latency Period (6 - 12 years): sexual desires hidden in unconscious
    
5. Genital Stage (12+ years): fully mature, sexual energy awakened
    

2. Erikson: Theory of Psychosocial Development
    

Developmental Process:

-8 stages categorized by crises that individual must resolve

1. Basic Trust v. Mistrust (0 - 1 years)
    

crisis: developing sense of trust with caregiver

2. Autonomy v. Shame and Doubt (1 - 3.5 years)
    

crisis: achieve sense of autonomy while adjusting to social demands, development leads to greater autonomy

3. Initiative v. Guilt (4 - 6 years)
    

crisis: identifying with parent to form conscience, achieve balance of initiative and guilt

4. Industry v. Inferiority (6 - puberty)
    

crisis: learning social skills and collaboration

5. Identity v. Role Confusion (adolescence - early adulthood)
    

crisis: developing identity

3. Current Perspectives
    

Freud: attachment theory (relations with caregivers impact child for life), cognitive science/neuroscience (the unconscious), infantile amnesia

Unconscious: racism and implicit association task, biases can be outside of our awareness, develop early on through experience (add more to this)

Erikson: adolescence profoundly affects life

Issues: to vague to be testable, Freud is highly questionable

  

2. Learning Theories
    

-emphasize external factors impacting development, continuity, mechanisms of change (principles of learning)

-differences emerge from different histories of reinforcement and observation

1. Watson: Behaviourism
    

-development determined by social environment, learning through conditioning (classically conditioned by life)

-invented feeding interval to avoid infant crying

-parents’ responsibility to create responsible citizen, be objective and distant with children

-child a clean slate that can be shaped into anything (no regard for nature, genetics, ability)

2. Skinner: Operant Conditioning
    

Operant Conditioning: repeat favourable actions

-everything we do is an operant response

-attention is powerful reinforcer

-difficult to reduce intermittently reinforced behaviour

Intermittent Reinforcement: inconsistent response

Behaviour Modification: therapy based on operant conditioning (reinforcing selected adaptive behaviours)

3. Bhandura: Social Learning Theory
    

-social development through learning mechanisms (observation and imitation), learning from vicarious reinforcement

-learning is all social, doesn’t need reinforcement

-attention to others’ behaviour, encoding, storing, retrieving to reproduce

Reciprocal Determinism: child influences and is influenced by environment

4. Current Perspectives
    

-based on experiments so more grounded

Issues: lacks attention to biological influences (perceptual, motor, cognitive development) on social development 

3. Theories of Social Cognition
    

-emphasize self-socialization

Self-Socialization: children play active role in socialization through preferences (friendship, activities)

1. Selman: Theory of Role Taking
    

Role Taking: being aware of other person’s POV, young children limited by inability to do this

1. Stage 1 (6 - 8 years): understand someone else can have different perspective, assume because of lack of information (my perspective is right, they will agree if they know what I know)
    
2. Stage 2 (8 - 10 years): can realize and think about different POV
    
3. Stage 3 (10 - 12 years): can compare other person’s POV to their own
    
4. Stage 4 (12+ years): can compare a POV to general POV
    

2. Dodge: Information Processing Theory of Social Problem Solving
    

-role of cognition in social behaviour

Hostile Attribution Bias: assume other people’s ambiguous actions have hostile intent (from early harsh parenting or physical abuse, also leads to lack of understanding of anger triggers)

3. Dweck: Theory of Self-Attribution and Achievement Motivation
    

Achievement Motivation: motivated by mastery or others’ view of success

Entity/Helpless Orientation: self worth is based on approval from others about personal qualities (challenges are a personal flaw), intelligence is fixed

Incremental/Mastery Orientation: self worth is based on effort and mastery not evaluation (enjoy challenge)

4. Current Perspectives
    

-active information seekers, effect of social experience depends on interpretation

Issues: no focus on biological factors

  

4. Ecological Theories
    

1. Ethnological and Evolutionary Theory
    

-understanding development in context of heritage

1. Ethnology: study of evolutionary basis of behaviour (adaptive and survival value), studying animal behaviour under natural conditions
    

Imprinting: new born birds and mammals attached to mother at first sight, stay near source of safety and food

-humans most attracted to humans

-emotional relationship with mother is like emotional imprinting

2. Evolutionary Theory:  emphasizes behaviour with adaptive function
    

-Darwin concepts of natural selection and adaptation

-large brain size tradeoff is extended immaturity and dependence

-birth occurs “too early” so head can fit through woman’s pelvis, brain keeps growing (led to increased social complexity)

-evolutionary history resulted in genetic predisposition to solve adaptive challenges (play)

-play evolved to learn, try out roles with no consequences

Parental Investment Theory: motivated to keep children alive by drive to perpetuate genes (mistreatment higher in step-parents)

Prolonged Period of Immaturity: allows more time to learn from experience, develop attachment, learn cultural knowledge, parents behaviour keeping child alive comes from evolutionary basis

2. Bronfenbrenner: Bioecological Model 
    

-development is set of nested structures, every level of environment influences child and each other

1. Microsystem: immediate environment surrounding child that they directly experience and participate in
    
2. Mesosystem: interconnections among microsystems (peers, family, school)
    
3. Exosystem: settings not directly experienced but still impacting (parents’ workplaces)
    
4. Macrosystem: beliefs, laws, customs of society
    
5. Chronosystem: historical changes influencing other systems
    

Children and Media:

Media: exosystem influenced by chronosystem

1. Violence: exposure increases child violence and aggression, teaches, activates, normalizes, arouses, desensitized (more antisocial later in life)
    
2. Social Media: cyberbullying, hate speech, harassment, mental health issues (what direction?)
    
3. Physical Inactivity: child obesity
    
4. Academics: heavy users have low grades
    
5. Porn: more tolerant or sexual aggression
    

3. Current Perspectives
    

-looking beyond lab, looking at biological nature

Issues: untestable, overlook autonomy of self

  

Week 9: Emotional Development (Chapter 10)

  

The Development of Emotions

Emotions: neural and physiological responses to environment (subjective feelings, cognitions relating to feelings, desire to take action)

-influenced by nature and nurture

Components:

1. neural response
    
2. physiological factors (heart rate, breathing rate, hormone levels)
    
3. subjective feelings
    
4. cognitions/perceptions
    
5. expressive behaviour or cognitive interpretation (desire to take action)
    

Debates:

-relative importance of each component

-innate v. learned emotions (research supports both)

-what is present throughout development and when?

Theories on Nature and Emergence of Emotion:

-everyone agrees cognition and experiences shape emotional development

1. Darwin: Discrete Emotions Theory: innate, automatic emotions developed through adaptation, each with distinct facial and bodily reaction
    

Proof: similar infant expressions/emotions, similar facial expressions across cultures, similar basic emotion vocalizations, can recognize basic emotions early in life

Srouge: emotions as continuums, cognition/social experiences lead to further

distinction and complexity

1. joy/pleasure
    
2. anger/frustration
    
3. wariness/fear
    

2. Functionalist Perspective: individuals experience emotions to manage relationship with environment
    

-function is to promote action towards achieving goal

-not discrete, vary based on environment

-appraisal occurs at subconscious level

The Emergence of Emotions:

Innate/Basic Emotions:

1. Happiness
    

-first sign is smile (when touched)

-3-4 months infants laugh

Social Smile (~2 months): smiles directed at people, elicit parental smile in response

Still Face Experiment: infants expect and enjoy being interacted with

2. Fear
    

-appears by 7 months (response and recognition of fear in others)

Separation Anxiety (8 months): distress due to separation from primary caregiver (whine, cry, display fear and upset), decline at 18 months

3. Anger
    

-more likely to be angry at people than objects

-usually paired with sadness in infants

-peaks at 18-24 months, decreases due to ability to verbally express and regulate emotions

4. Sadness
    

-same scenarios as anger (painful or loss of control)

-intense sadness when separated from caregivers

5. Surprise
    

-not automatic (morrow), cognitive understanding that something is different or new

-expressed by 6 months

-important to early learning

-depressed mother = less surprise (in baby and mother), infant models after parent

6. Disgust
    

-avoid poison and bacteria

-mostly directed at food, learned

Self Conscious Emotions: require a sense of self as separate from others

-not developed until ~2 years

-require sense of sense/need for acceptance and social expectations.

1. Guilt: action focused
    

-empathy for others, remorse/regret about behavior, wish to undo consequences

2. Shame: self-worth focused
    

-unconcerned with others

-same experience can elicit shame in some, guilt in others, based on parental practices (emphasizing badness of action or child)

3. Jealousy
    
4. Empathy
    
5. Pride
    
6. Embarrassment: mismatch between self-concept and others’ concept of you
    

-~15 months children show embarrassment when center of attention

  

Understanding Emotions

-identifying emotions, meanings, social functions and factors affecting

-critical to development of social competence

Identifying Emotions of Others:

-first step in development of emotional knowledge

3 months: distinguish happy, surprise, anger facial expressions

7 months: distinguish fear, sadness and interest facial expressions

8-12 months: social referencing: using emotions of others to decide how to react in unfamiliar situations

16-18 months: prefer toys associated with happy sounds and expressions

3 years: can label facial expressions for big 6

middle elementary school: understand self-conscious emotions

Social Referencing: using parent/adult face/vocal cues to decide how to deal with novel, ambiguous, threatening situations

-violent environment: heightened awareness to emotional conflict cues, less likely to detect sadness (adaptive)

Understanding Real and False Emotions:

-understanding that expression doesn’t always match feeling

-understanding is linked to increased cognitive capacities and social factors

Display Rules: social group norms about when, where, how much one should show and suppress emotions 

False emotions to:

1. simulate emotions (be nice)
    
2. masking as self-protection (acting unphased to avoid bullying)
    

  

Emotion Regulation:

-crucial to cognitive and behavioural success

Emotional Intelligence: better predictor of how people do in life than IQ

Marshmallow Test: predicts social, emotional, academic success years later

Emotion Regulation: conscious and unconscious methods to monitor, modulate emotional experiences and expressions

Development:

1. Recognize emotion
    
2. Inhibit/control response
    

Co-Regulation: caregiver provides comfort and distraction to child distress

5 months: start own emotion regulation with:

Self-Comforting Behaviours: repetitive actions regulating arousal by providing mildly positive physical sensation

Transitional Object: comfort object to hold onto in times of distress

Self-Distraction: looking away from upsetting stimuli

1st year: decrease self-comforting in favour of self-distracting behaviours

-changes due to neurological maturatiuon (frontal lobe), changes in expectations (manage own behaviours)

9-12 months: aware of adult demands and self-regulate accordingly

-older children use cognitive strategies and problem solving to deal with problems

Relation of Emotion Regulation to Social Competence and Adjustment:

Social Competence: ability to achieve goals in social interactions while maintaining positive relations with others

-more self-control = more well-adjusted, well liked, better emotion and stress management, do better in school

  

Role of Family in Emotional Development:

-parents have impact on interpreting own and others’ emotions

1. Parents’ Emotional Expression
    

-provides model of appropriate emotional responses

Open Expression: well-adjusted, socially skilled, low aggression

Negative Emotions: low level of social competence, experience negative emotions (anxiety/depression)

-infants are attuned to mother’s emotional expression (still face experiment)

2. Parents’ Socialization of Children’s Emotional Responses
    

Emotion Socialization: acquiring standards, values, knowledge, behaviours deemed appropriate in culture for present and future role

-determined by reactions from parents and discussions, culture plays role

1. Parents’ Reactions to Children’s Emotions
    

-directly influences expression, social competence

Dismissive: feel invalid, less socially competent (lower sympathy, worse at coping with stress, more prone to anger)

Supportive: help child learn to express emotions constructively, more validated, better adjusted (better in school, more socially competent)

2. Parents’ Discussions of Emotions
    

-teaching about meaning, timing, context appropriateness, consequences of expressing emotions

Emotion Coaching: discussing and teaching how to deal with emotions, leads to better emotional understanding, more social competence/empathy, less problem behaviours

  

Temperament:

Temperament: individual differences in emotion, activity level, attention across contexts from infancy (genetically based), varies across individual and group

1. Easy: adjust to new situations, quickly establish daily routines, generally cheerful, easy to calm
    
2. Difficult: slow to adjust, react negatively to novel stimuli, irregular daily routines
    
3. Slow to Warm Up: difficult at first but become easy over time with repeated contact with new people, objects, situations
    

Measuring Temperament:

-now categorized with within-person approach not between-person approach

-each child has some level of each dimension of temperament

-stable, predicts later development of behavioural issues, axiety disorders, social competence

Dimensional Survey (Parents):

Dimensions:

1. fear
    
2. distress/anger/frustration
    
3. attention span
    
4. activity level
    
5. smiling and laughter
    

Pro: parents know kid best, based on long time

Con: may be biased, do not have wide comparison

Lab Testing:

1. Heart rate variability in temperament differences (reflects nervous system response)
    
2. Electroencephalographic recording of frontal lobe
    

Left active: positive affect, sociability, exploration

Right active: withdraw, uncertainty, anxiety

Pro: less biased

Con: only observed in limited time and circumstance

Determinants of Temperament

 -basis in biology and genetics

-teratogens (nutritional deficiencies, cocaine, stress, anxiety) changes temperament

-home environment 

Passive Gene-Environment Correlation: through parental genetics and home they create

-child's actions 

How Temperament Fits with Environment:

Goodness of Fit: degree to which temperament matches the demands and expectations of environment

-family most influential 

Differential Susceptibility: same temperament characteristic that is high risk for negative outcomes in harsh home can have positive outcomes in good home

  

Mental Health, Stress, Internalizing Mental Disorders

Mental Health: sense of internal and external wellbeing

Stress

Stress: physiological response to change or threat in environment

-adaptive function to mobilize to take action

Traumatic Stress: severe stress brought on by sudden catastrophic event (usually high levels of emotion, mood disorders)

Internalizing Mental Disorders:

Mental Disorders: problems with emotional reactions to environment or social relations that impacts daily life

Internalizing: inside emotional states

Externalizing: disruptive/aggressive

Equifinality: various causes can lead to same disorder

Multifinality: certain causes do not always lead to mental disorder

1. Depression: mental disorder involving sad and irritable mood and physical and cognitive changes interfering with daily life
    

Nature: elevated cortisol, genetics (40% accountable)

Nurture: parental sensitivity, support, acceptance, parental negativity

Cognitive Factors: see themselves as causes of negative events, rumination

-problems with peer relations (direction of causation unknown)

2. Anxiety: set of mental disorders involving inability to regulate fear and worry
    

-overactivation of threat brain areas (amygdala and hippocampus, sympathetic nervous system)

Separation Anxiety: intrusive, requiring constant attention

Nature: ⅓ heritable, some from temperament

Nurture: conditioning, observation, instruction, parents’ behaviour (controlling or overprotective)

Treatment:

1. drug therapy (serotonin reuptake inhibitors)
    
2. cognitive-behavioural therapy (recognize and change maladaptive thoughts and behaviours, as effective as drugs)
    

  

Empathy and Compassion Video

-how much of hurry we are in determines how much we will help

-automatic impulse is to help/feel with someone else

-preoccupied and self-focused = not helping others

-helping to feel good about ourselves

-must pay full attention to have empathy

-focusing on ourselves means “turning that [empathy] part of ourselves off”

  

Week 10: Attachment and the Self (Chapter 11)

Attachment: emotional bond with specific person enduring over space and time

-use caregiver bond to model other life relationships

-mental representation of self, caregivers and others formed by attachment

-extended period of dependency allows for social bonds, learning, communication

-responds to caregiver responsiveness

Critical Period for forming attachment: first 2 years

  

The Caregiver-Child Attachment Relationship

-emotional attachment deprivation = hindered social/cognitive development

Behaviourism: food is bases for bond (link food to mother through classical conditioning)

Harry Harlow: monkeys prefer cloth mother even when doesn’t have food, physical comfort is basis for bond

-bonding to nurturing mom is essential to mental health, normal development

-forms blueprint bond other attachments are modelled after

1. Cloth v. Wire: monkeys prefer cloth non-nutritive mother to wire nutrituve one
    
2. Total Isolation: total social isolation leads to aggressive and antisocial behaviours, females were neglectful and abusive to young
    
3. Critical Periods: number of days raised in total isolation impacts behaviour in social groups 
    

Isolation (lack of sufficient bond) in Orphanages:

-physical care and nutrition are not enough

-social isolation hinders optimal social, cognitive and emotional development

-babies need attachment and love

Elinor Ames:

-studied 3 groups (Canadian born, early adopted and orphanage raised), measured cognitive, motor, social, emotional milestones

-more serious problems in orphanage raised kids

-attachment is critical to development

-evidence that sensitive/critical period for attachment is before 2 years (foster care studies)

  

Bowlby: Attachment Theory:

-biologically predisposed to develop strong caregiver attachment to increase survival

-inspired by Freud (early relationships shape later development)

Secure Base: presence of trusted caregiver provides sense of security making child feel comfortable exploring environment, leads to greater knowledge and competence 

Purposes:

1. enhances change of survival (close to caregiver)
    
2. emotional security, allow to explore world without fear
    
3. co-regulation, helping manage arousal and emotion
    

-formed from innate basis, quality from experience

Internal Working Model of Attachment: child’s mental representation of self and attachment figure relationships constructed from experiences, guides expectations through life

  

Measurement of Attachment Security:

Ainsworth: Strange Situation Procedure: child placed in room with toys, exposed to separation/reunion with parent and stranger interactions

-rate behaviours to infer closeness (reunion especially)

-Ainsworth noticed patterns of behaviour after separation in US and Uganda

Criticism: requires substantial resources, should be continuous dimensions, no longer so strange (daycare is common)

1. Secure: secure base, presence of mom is calming, trusting
    

-forms important foundation of learning and growth

-⅔ of US middle class kids

2. Insecure/Resistant: clingy, stay close, not easily comforted
    
3. Insecure/Avoidant: indifferent, avoid caregiver, as easily comforted by stranger
    
4. Disorganized/Disoriented: no consistency (want to approach caregiver but fear them also)
    

-prefer level of responsiveness of parent, not always most attentive (forming social expectations)

  

Phases of Attachment:

1. Preattachment (0-6 weeks):
    

-infant produces innate signals to make others attend to it, comforted by interactions

2. Attachment-in-the-Making (6 wks-8 months):
    

-respond preferentially to familiar people

3. Clear-cut Attachment (8 months-1.5/2 years):
    

-actively seek out contact with caregiver, separation anxiety when caregiver leaves

4. Reciprocal Relationships (1.5/2years +):
    

-active role in developing working partnership with caregivers

Outcome: enduring emotional tie with caregiver, internal working model of attachment 

  
  

Sources of Individual Differences in Attachment Styles

1. Parental Sensitivity: expressions of warmth/responsiveness to children
    

-responsiveness in timely/appropriate manner

-contingency (subtle responses to behaviour)

-mirroring (immitating facial expressions)

-infant-directed speech

Secure: positive exchanges, warmth

Resistant: inconsistent response

Avoidant: indifferent response

Disorganized: abusive/frightening response 

2. Genetic Predisposition
    

-no evidence of heritability, epigenetics may play role

-certain genes can be associated with certain attachment depending on environment (differential susceptibility)

-lasts into adulthood

3. Culture
    

-in all countries children use mother as secure base, physical proximity differs

Attachment and Social-Emotional Development:

-attachment predicts later social-emotional development

Secure: better adjusted, more social skills (from positive internal models of attachment), learn acceptable to express emotions, better relationships, emotional/physical health, better academic performance, better peer relations and understanding of others

Avoidant: inhibit emotional expression, not seek comfort from others

Resistant: more depressed, anxious, socially withdrawn, aggressive, delinquent

  

Basic Tenets of Attachment Theory:

-foundational theory in psychology

1. Monotropy: innate, inborn capacity to attach primarily to single caregiver
    
2. Stranger Anxiety: ~8 months show distress about unfamiliar others
    
3. Definition of Attachment: hierarchical model with mom at top
    

Keller questions generalizability:

-ethnographic evidence in different cultures of multiple caregivers, no stranger anxiety, mother among many caregivers (not hierarchical)

  

The Self

1. Self-Concept: conceptual system made up of one’s thoughts and attitudes about oneself 
    

-based on physical, social, internal attributes

-develops through interaction with people and environments

Infancy:

-starts as awareness of physical self, learn can affect their environment

2-4 months: have a sense of ability to control objects outside self

8 months: begin to have separation distress (understand mother and me are different entities)

15 months: distinguish self and others by gender and age

18-20 months: recognize self in mirror (culturally dependent)

2 years: recognize self in photo, experience guilt/shame

3 years: memories of life story

Childhood:

-socially constructed self-concept based on observations and evaluations (direct or indirect) of others (especially caregivers)

3-4 years: understand self in terms of concrete characteristics, preferences, possessions

-unrealistically confident

Social Comparison: comparing own behaviour and functioning to others to evaluate self

8-11 years: higher order conceptions, more global view of self, more balanced, realistic (can result in helplessness and inferiority)

-increasingly based on evaluation of others, low self-esteem if others treat negatively

Adolescence:

-abstract thinking allows for multiple selves, resolved in late adolescence

Early: concern over social competence and acceptance amplified

Personal Fable: egocentrism where self beliefs and values are lovely differentiated making one feel unique and special

Imaginary Audience: egocentrism-born feeling that everyone is concerned with your appearance and eahaviour because you are

Mid: conflicted about self discrepancies

Late: integrate selves, less determined by what others think, more focused on meeting own standards and future goals

  

2. Self-Esteem: individual’s overall evaluations of worth and feelings about evaluation, emerges ~8 years
    

-low self-esteem = anxiety, depression, bullying

Sources of Self-Esteem:

1. age (high in childhood, declines in adolescence, high in adulthood)
    
2. physical attributes (attractive higher)
    
3. gender (boys higher)
    
4. approval/support from others (grounded in parent relationship)
    
5. parent behaviour/discipline
    
6. peer acceptance
    
7. school/neighbourhood environment
    

Culture and Self Esteem:

Western: self-esteem is individual accomplishments, higher, comfortable with

praise and standing out

Asian: self-esteem is contributing to welfare of groups, affirming norms of social

interdependence, lower in collectivist cultures because emphasis on modesty

-across all cultures men have higher self-esteem

  

3. Identity: definition of self, often externally imposed
    

-we have many for different contexts. 

Erikson: all adolescents have identity crisis to separate from parents

Identity Achievement: integration of selves into whole stable over time and events

Moratorium: exploring occupational/ideological choices without commitment

Identity Foreclosure: committed to identity without exploration (usually based on values and choices of others)

Identity Diffusion: not committed or exploring, make no effort to reach identity 

-parental support = less identity confusion

-parental control = less commitment 

Ethnic and Racial Identity: beliefs/attitudes about ethnic/racial group you belong to

Ethnicity: cultural relationships/experiences, ancestry, religion, native language

Race: physical characteristics (social construct)

Acculturation: adjusting to new culture while retaining aspects of origin culture

Sexual Identity: sense of self as sexual being

Sexual Orientation: preference of sexual partner/attraction object

Sexual-Minority Youth: gay youth

Week 11: The Family (Chapter 12)

  

Family: group with at least one adult related to child, responsible for child’s necessities, love, support, safety, stability, learning opportunities, crucial to development (microsystem)

Purpose:

-survival of offspring

-economic function

-cultural training (skill to survive in society)

  

Family Structure: number of relationships amongst people living in household

Changes:

1. more children with lone, unmarried parents (financial/time implications)
    
2. first time parents are older (delaying children and teen birth rate is less, more planned pregnancies, fewer children, more financial resources)
    
3. more children live with grandparents (more behavioural problems)
    
4. smaller families (delaying pregnancies, increased access to birth control)
    
5. structures are more fluid (changes in structure = more issues)
    
6. Same Sex Parents: children not different in mental health, behaviour, academic performance
    
7. Divorced Parents: most repartner, lots of changes (less emotional support, financial hardship, moving lead to low self-esteem, sadness, depression, aggression, antisocial behaviour)
    
8. Stepparents: less frequent contact with non custodial parent after remarriage, more frequent abuse
    

  

Family Dynamics:  operation as a whole determines how well family fulfills basic child-rearing functions, all members influence each other

Parenting:

Socialization: process of acquiring values, standards, beliefs, skills, knowledge, behaviours appropriate for present and future role in culture

Direct Instructors: explicit teaching

Indirect Socialization: transmit information through interactions

Providers/Controllers of Opportunity: manage children’s experiences and

social lives

Socialization of Help-Seeking Behaviour Study in Japan/Canada/USA:

-tested 3 and 5 year-olds to see at what age children become resourceful

-2 experimenters, one can’t get toy out of box, one can

-Canadian 5 year-olds asked the effective experimenter for help

-Japanese 5-year olds continued trying to do it themselves, very few asked for help

-American 5-year olds asked for help right away without barely trying

  

Resourceful: consider knowledge/expertise of person before asking them for help

1. Discipline: strategies/behaviours parents use to teach children how to behave appropriately, most effective when leads to internalization 
    

Internalization: permanent change due to child understanding/accepting reason for change

Other-Oriented Induction: focusing on how actions affect others, promotes internalization

-too much pressure = not effective for internalization

Punishment: negative stimulus following behaviours to reduce repetition, not effective because do not teach why/how to behave properly

2. Parenting Style: behaviours and attitudes of parents that set emotional climate in regard to parent-child interactions and environment 
    

1. degree of warmth/responsiveness
    
2. degree of control/demandingness
    

Types:

1. Authoritative: high in demand and support
    

-clear standards/limits enforced

-allow autonomy, attentive to concerns/needs of child, respect and consider child’s POV

Results: competent, self-assured, popular, low in antisocial behaviour

2. Authoritarian: high in demandingness, low in response
    

-high control/demand, enforce demands through power and hostility

Results: low in social/academic competence, unhappy, unfriendly, low self-confidence, delinquency, depression, alcoholism

3. Permissive: low in demand high in response
    

-too responsive, no regulation

Results: impulsive, low self-regulation, low academic achievement, high externalization of problems, higher drug use

4. Uninvolved/Rejcting-Neglecting/Disengeged: low response and low demand
    

-no limits, no support, neglectful

Results: low academic achievement, antisocial, alcoholism and drug use

Cultural Differences:

-results vary culturally, no correct style

-important that parenting style matches cultural norms 

-African American adolescents: authoritarian led to more positive outcomes

-Chinese/Chinese-American families: less negative outcomes from authoritarian

than Euro-American families

Child Impacts: bidirectional interaction 

-attractiveness

-behaviour

-temperament

Other Factors:

1. Socioeconomic Status: strong predictor of parenting style
    

-authoritarian may be adaptive for protection in unsafe living conditions 

2. Economic Stress: strong negative predictor of parenting/interaction quality and child adjustment
    

  

Divorce: significant predictors of impact

1. stress in new family arrangement
    
2. remarriage
    
3. personality and coping capacities of child
    
4. level of parental conflict prior to, during and after divorce
    
5. -custody and cooperation
    
6. -age of child
    

  

Differences in Mother/Father Interactions: mothers spend more time with kids (emotional/physical care), fathers more physical play, equally important

Child Influence on Parenting: temperament

Bidirectionality: parents and children mutually affected by characteristics and behaviours (positive and negative)

Sibling Relationships: playmate, support, security, instruction, caregiving, teaches conflict resolution when parents mediate, get along more if parents do also, preferential treatment leads to conflict

  

Child Maltreatment

Maltreatment: action/failure to act from caregiver resulting in physical or emotional harm to child or risk of serious harm (can be more than parent, anyone responsible for child)

1. neglect
    
2. physical abuse
    
3. emotional harm
    
4. sexual abuse
    
5. exposure to family violence
    

Polyvictimization: co-occurence of multiple forms

Risks for Maltreatment:

-lack of knowledge

-low income

-inadequate housing

-social isolation

-alcohol/drug abuse

-abusive parent relationships

Consequences:

-increased fear, anger, sadness

-disorganized attachment

-cognitive delays, antisocial/risky behaviour

-increased psychiatric disorder risk

-more chronic maltreatment = worse outcomes

  

Family Socioeconomic Context

-most frequent context is family so most influential

1. Cultural Context: varies by degree of parent discipline, degree same behaviour results in same child outcome
    

-success of disciplinary technique depends on cultural context and normativity

2. Economic Context: variation in enrichment and necessities, time spent, stress
    
3. Parents’ Work Context: stress, time, paid leave
    
4. Availability of Childcare
    

  
  

Week 12: Theories of Moral Development (Chapter 14)

Moral Judgement:

Morals: individuals own principles of right and wrong

-reasoning for behaviour determines morality

Necessary Features for Morality:

1. conscience: be concerned about acting morally and feel guilty when not
    
2. know right from wrong
    
3. know why certain acts are moral or immoral
    

Cognitive Requirements:

1. assessing goals, intentions, desires, beliefs of others
    
2. acting appropriately (rectifying situation) at a cost to oneself
    
3. should we punish others who hinder? (even 8 month olds do this)
    

  

1. Piaget: Theory of Moral Judgment
    

-moral reasoning develops from following to appreciating rules

-caused by interactions with peers more than adults (children learn in games)

-starts with outcome importance, moves to intention

-underestimated children’s ability to factor in intentions

Stage 1: Heteronomous Morality (<7 yrs):

Possible Causes:

-cognitive belief that rules exist outside the mind

-social experience with parents placing rules

Characteristics:

-justice is what authorities say is right, punishment always justified

-believe rules are unchangeable due to social (parental control) and cognitive (immaturity) factors

-morality determined by outcome

Stage 1.5: Transitional (7-8 - 10 yrs):

-develop ability to take perspective of others

-more egalitarian play and give and take

-begin to value fairness and equality

Stage 2: Autonomous Morality (11-12 years):

Characteristics:

-understand rules are product of socializing to maintain order, can be changed if majority agrees to do so

-don’t blindly follow authority

-fairness is important when making rules

-punishment should fit crime

-intentions determine morality

Critique:

-young children can also understand intention in actions (<2 yrs)

  

2. Kohlberg: Theory of Moral Reasoning
    

-moral reasoning (ways you solve an ethical dilemna) is the basis for ethical behaviour

-discontinuous, hierarchical stages

Method:

-interviewed boys starting at 10-16 years every 3 years for 20 years

-presented them with a moral dilemma with conflict between two moral values

-asked what should the actor do and why?

Heinz Dilemma: wife is dying and drug is overpriced so they can’t afford it. should husband steal the drug?

Focus:

-interested in process of reasoning not content of response

Important Factors:

1. actively grappling with moral issues, noticing weaknesses in one’s reasoning)
    
2. gaining perspective taking, enabling the more effective moral conflict resolution
    

1. Preconventional Level: self-centered, focus on getting rewards/avoiding punishment 
    

-focused on avoiding punishment

-follow law to avoid punishment

1. Punishment and Obedience Orientation: obedience is right
    
2. Instrument and Exchange Orientation: own self-interest is right
    

2. Conventional Level: focus on social relationships
    

-rules are social contracts followed to preserve social relationships

     3. Mutual Interpersonal Expectations, Relationships, Interpersonal Conformity Orientation: what people/role expects is right

       4. Social System and Conscience Orientation: fulfilling duties is right

3. Postconventional/Principled Level: focus on ideals
    

-reasoning according to own ideals or moral principles

     5. Social Contract and Individual Rights Orientation: best for group is right

     6. Universal Ethical Principles: own ethical principles are right

Critique:

-only studied men (ethic of justice vs. ethic of care)

-many people do not reach step 6

-social convention and morality not differentiated

-cultural differences

-discontinuity (people switch between levels)

-gender differences (biased against women)

Sex and Ethics:

Gilligan: feminine morality emphasizes ethic of care

Women: in US and Canada use caring, responsiveness and empathetic perspective taking more than men

Men: wither focus on justice or both justice and care, rarely privileging care

  

3. Social Domain Theory of Moral Development (current)
    

-gradual change based on socialization and environmental experiences

-parents transmit values explicitly and implicitly

-peers are strong influence 

Social Knowledge Domains:

1. Moral Domain: understanding right/wrong, fairness, justice, individual rights (and that these apply accropss contexts and superceded authority)
    
2. Societal Domain: rules and conventions to maintain societal order, negotiate social interactions
    
3. Personal Domain: no right/wrong, actions determined by personal choice, central to identity and autonomy development 
    

Differences:

-social order maintained through norms

-moral judgements are mostly universal

-helping others is moral obligation or choice depending on culture

-religion impacts morality

Conscience: internal regulatory mechanism increasing individual’s ability to conform to standards of conduct

-innate drive to help over hinder others

-culturally sensitive (take parents’ moral values)

-temperament impacts conscience

  

Prosocial Behaviour: helpful voluntary action to benefit others without necessarily providing any direct benefits to person performing act, may even involve a risk to actor

Altruism: behaviour that reflects unselfish concern for welfare of others, often at a personal cost

Development:

-begins with capacity for empathy and sympathy (cause altruistic motives)

Empathy: emotional response to another’s emotional state or condition

-understand emotion of others and that they are in need, feel emotion in response

Sympathy: concern at feelings of others in response to other’s emotional state or condition

14 months: able to take someone else’s POV, experience empathy

-children become emotionally distressed when they see other people who are upset

-children show concern for an adult who has been hurt

18-24 months: able to act on empathy (begin to understand social norms)

-children share a personal object with an adult they saw being harmed by another

2-4 years: helping behaviours

-children will help someone get something out of reach

-children are ready to engage in sharing/helping/comforting behaviours around same age but there are individual differences in spontaneous propensity to do so

Proactive Helping: help without being asked

Reactive Helping: help if asked explicitly

Cooperation: driven by sympathy/fairness, evolved especially in humans

Origins of Individual Differences:

1. Biological Factors:
    

-humans are biologically predisposed to be prosocial

-MZ twins more similar than DZ twins in self-reports of empathy/prosocial behaviour

-temperament impacts

2. Socialization:
    

Family:

1. Modeling: imitate helping behaviours, influence how much and to who
    
2. Opportunities: helping around house, community service
    
3. Discipline: constructive/supportive parenting, explaining why things are wrong/who you hurt to understand impacts on others
    

Sense of Fairness:

-in Western research between 5-7 children shift from self-focus to other-focus

Rochat: Distributive Justice Study: how does a sense of fairness develop?

-200 3-7 year olds in seven societies

-split candies between yourself and others

-between 3-5 years children shift into more fair splitting of candies, less selfish

-more perspective taking means more fairness

False Belief Task: 85% of 5 year olds passed, 25% of 3 year olds passed

-shift in ability take perspective of another individual

Perfect Share: I split, you choose (results in more fair splitting if they passed false belief)

Causes of Prosocial Behaviour:

1. reasoning and explaining to children
    
2. closeness, attachment
    
3. modeling
    
4. encouraging perspective taking
    
5. warmth alone is insufficient, must be combined with specific parenting practices
    

  

Antisocial Behaviour: disruptive, hostile, aggressive behaviour that violates social norms and rules or takes advantage of others

Aggression: intentional acts to harm others

-physical aggression increases until language acquisition, then goes down as verbal aggression increases

Instrumental Aggression: motivated by desire to obtain concrete goal (fighting over toy)

Relational Aggression: harm others by damaging peer relationships (exclusion)

-level of aggression consistent through life

-many aggressive children have neurological deficits resulting in relationship struggles (especially attention problems, can’t consider everything before acting)

Origins:

1. Biological: 
    

-antisocial behaviours run in families (heredity impacts more in childhood than adolescence)

-difficult temperament 

2. Social:
    

-reaction to interpretation of social situations (hostile attribution bias)

-don’t realize being aggressive, think appropriate response

Reactive Aggression: emotionally driven aggression sparked by perception of others’ motivations as hostile

Proactive Aggression: fulfilling need/desire 

3. Family:
    

-harsh/low-quality parenting (insecure attachment, difficult temperament)

-spanking increases aggression

-poor parental monitoring

-parental conflict

-socioeconomic status (stress, exposure to violence, worse schooling)

4. Peers: 
    

-socialize with other aggressive peers

5. Interventions:
    

-less aggressive if in supportive, rich environment

-individual psychotherapy

-drug therapy

-parental education

  

Week 13: Gender Development (Chapter 15)

-more similar than different

-not all boys/girls alike

-more complex than dichotomy

Sex and Gender:

Sex: genetic distinction of males/females (XY/XX chromosomes)

Gender: social assignment/self-categorization

Cisgender: gender and sex assigned at birth match

Transgender: identify with different gender than assigned at birth

Nonbinary/Genderqueer: do not identify with one category

Genderfluid: identify with different gender category depending on context

Bigender: identify with both genders

Agender: identify with no genders

Gender-Typing: process of gender socialization

Gender-Types: stereotypical/expected behaviours for that gender

Cross-Gender-Typed: stereotypes/expectations for opposite gender

Gender Nonconforming: highly cross-gender-typed behaviours

Comparison Measures:

Effect Size: magnitude of overlapping in average/amount of overlap in distribution

negligible: > 85%

small: 67 - 85%

medium: 53 - 66%

large: < 53%

very large: < 30%

Meta-Analysis: summarize average effect size across several studies

  

Theoretical Approaches to Gender:

1. Biological Influences: genes, hormones, brain
    

1. genes
    
2. hormones and brian functioning
    

Androgens: class of steroids (T) that occur higher in men

Organizing Influences: sex-linked hormones affect brain differentiation/organization in prenatal development and puberty

Activating Influences: occur when fluctuations in sex-linked hormone levels influence activation of brain and behavioural responses

3. brain structure/functioning
    

2. Cognitive/Motivational Influences
    

-learn gender-typed attitudes

Self-Socialization: use beliefs/expectations/preferences to guide world perceptions/actions

-seek to act in accord with gender identity

1. Cognitive Development Theory: 
    

-actively seek to understand meaning of gender

-cognitive development changes understanding of gender in early childhood 

1. Gender Identity (30 months): self categorizing
    
2. Gender Stability (3-4 yrs): awareness of stability over time
    
3. Gender Constancy (6 yrs): invariant despite superficial changes
    

-then start to conform to gender

  

2. Gender Schema Theory:
    

-motivated to follow gender-typed behaviour begins as soon as can label gender (~3 yrs)

Gender Schemas: mental representations incorporating everything a child knows about gender

-prefer own gender (ingroup/outgroup), remember more about gender-typed objects/activities/people

Gender Schema Filter: is this relevant for my gender?

Interest Filter: is this personally interesting?

3. Social Cognitive Theory:
    

-triadic model of reciprocal causation between personal, environmental and behavioural factors

Learning:

1. Tuition: direct teaching
    
2. Enactive Experience: guide behaviours by past reactions to behaviours
    
3. Observational Learning: seeing/encoding consequences of others’ actions
    

-gender development is process of self-regulation and monitoring behaviour to see if it matches personal standards

Self-Efficacy: positive self reaction (matches standards)

4. Social Identity Theory
    

-influence of group membership

-gender is most central social identity to children, used to structure/organize social life in every culture

Ingroup Bias: evaluate ingroup more positively than outgroup

Ingroup Assimilation: conform to group norms for acceptance

Intersectionality: overlapping social identities (relating to discrimination)

5. Integrative Theoretical Approaches
    

Developmental Intergroup Theory: psychological salience of gender leads to stereotyping and prejudice 

Gender Self-Socialization Model: process of self-socializing to adapt to expectations of environment

Stereotypic Emulation Hypothesis: the more you identify with gender ingroup the more you adhere to stereotypes

Stereotype-Construction Hypothesis: form generalized beliefs about genders

Identity-Construction Hypothesis: identify more with gender ingroup when own attributes match stereotypes

3. Cultural Influences 
    

1. Bioecological Model:
    

Opportunity Structure: economic and social resources offered by macrosystem

  

Milestones in Gender Development:

1. Infancy to Toddlerhood:
    

-identify females/males based on physical attributes

-establish gender expectations (6-12 months)

-label gender of others (2.5 yrs)

2. Preschool (3-5 yrs):
    

-learn gender stereotypes

-preference for gender-typed toys by 2 yrs

Gender Segregation: prefer to play with same gender peers, avoid opposite

3. Middle Childhood:
    

-more flexibility in gender stereotypes/beliefs due to gender constancy

-realization of gender discrimination

-same gender peer groups have different norms of behaviour

Assertion: attempt to exert influence over environment

Affiliation: making connections with others

Collaboration: goals blended together

-gender typing more rigid for boys than girls

4. Adolescence:
    

Gender Role Intensification: heightened concerns about adhering to gender roles

Ambivalent Sexism: hostile (control) sexism balanced with benevolent (protection) sexism

Gender Reflexibility: recognition of gender as social conventions, adoption of more flexible attitude

-increased intimacy and closeness in peer relationships

  

Patterns of Gender Development:

1. Physical Growth
    

Prenatal:

-androgens makes you a male at 6-8 wks

Intersex: both, opposite or underdeveloped genitals

Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH): androgen presence cause development of male like genitals in biological female

Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS): androgen malfunction in genetic males, born with female genitals but not female reproductive structures

Childhood/Adolescence:

Puberty: developmental period marked by ability to reproduce/dramatic body changes

Menarche: first period

Spermarche: first ejaculation

Body Image: feelings and perceptions of body

Adrenarche: first sexual attraction resulting from matiration of adrenal glands

2. Cognitive Abilities/Academic Achievement
    

General Intelligence: same IQ, girls achieve higher grades in school

Verbal Skill: girls slightly advanced

Spatial Ability: boys somewhat better at mental rotations

Explanations:

-brain/hormonal

-cognitive/motivational

-parental influence

-teacher influence

-peer influences

-cultural influences

3. Interpersonal Goals and Communication
    

boys: dominance/power

girls: intimacy/support

Aggression: boys more direct aggression, same level indirect
