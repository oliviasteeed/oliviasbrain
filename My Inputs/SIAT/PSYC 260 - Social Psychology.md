## Notes

Week 1: Group Processes

Lecture Week 1: 

Course Themes:

1. Power of Social Situation: human behaviour (how people think/feel/behave) is driven in large (underappreciated) part to the social situation they are in
    
2. Importance of Subjective Construal: subjective interpretation of situation can matter more than objective reality
    
Latane & Darley (1970):

-people doing survey in hotel meeting room, experimenters pipe in smoke/turn on fire alarm to see how people alone and with confederates (who don’t react) will react

- alone 75% of people leave in 6 minutes (should be 98% if 3 people then)
    
- group of 3, 38% leave by 6 minutes 
    
- behvaviour shaped by social situation 

Social Facilitation Theory:

Zajonc (1969) Cockroach Study: testing influence of peers on performance

1. measured speed of cockroach running away from light alone
    
2. measured speed of cockroach running away when watched (faster)
    
Simple Task = faster when audience

1. measured speed of cockroach escaping light through maze alone
    
2. measured speed of cockroach escaping light through maze with audience (slower)

Complex Task = slower with audience

  

Social Facilitation Theory:

James Michaels & co (1982)

1. campus pool hall experimenters identified novices and experts
    
2. novices performance decreased (fewer shots)
    
3. experts: performance increased (made more shots)
    

- arousal means dominant response (can be bad or good depending on practice)
    

  

Social Loafing Theory:

Bibb Latane & co (1979)

1. subjects wore blindfolds and headphones, told to clap
    
2. some told they were alone, some told they were in a group
    
3. group = made ⅓ of noise as made alone
    

  

Textbook Chapter 8: Group Processes 

  

Group: 3+ (usually 3-6) interdependent people interacting with each other (needs/goals lead them to rely on each other)

1. basic human need to belong (Baumeister + Leary 1995) (social species, desire to be part of something bigger, depressed when lacking this)
    
2. evolutionary aid to survival (accomplish more than alone, food, safety, mates)
    
3. important aspect of identity (Dion 2000)
    
4. increase engagement in social action
    

Social Norms: expectations in a group of all members

Social Roles: expectation about how particular people/positions behave (leader, coach, assistant)

pros: know what to expect

cons: lose personal identity

Gender Roles: expectations of behaviour based on gender

Group Cohesiveness: qualities binding a group

-more cohesive = more friendly (this does not predict success)

Group Diversity: members tend to be alike

1. groups attract similar members
    
2. groups encourage similarity
    

  

Group Behavioural Influence:

1. Social Facilitation: when watched = better performance simple task (default to dominant response), worse complex task![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Cs1lGPanUWMN_GS0XRld9fBOSdThGjtKG7JCpdngth3LrEk3i6QooHYPyQkkzPZgibQLyMnUz2YeBivjucPKaeRtpTeHlZB3RrGfoJsotAuLvNskrfI3_nKO5_IJLYo-cPJ4lcKHclzY5PexxyQgjRo)
    

(when individually assessed)

1. presence of others increases arousal
    

1. other people make us more alert/vigilant
    
2. Evaluative Apprehension makes us try to perform better
    
3. presence of others can also distract from task
    

3. arousal makes simple tasks easier (energizes) but complex tasks harder
    

Arousal = favours dominant response (good at familiar, bad at hard)

- task difficulty is subjective based on practice and expertise (goal is to practice until task is subjectively easy so crowd/audience improves performance)
    

2. Social Loafing: in a group = better performance on complex task (more relaxed, less anxiety), worse on simple task (relax and rely on others)
    

(when group assessed, individual behaviour not identifiable)

-men/Western cultures/more diverse groups more likely to do this

Deindividuation: becoming lost in a crowd leads to unleashing independently unacceptable behaviours

1. presence of others lowers self-awareness/moral standards
    
2. increases extent of following group norms (determining behaviour)
    

  

Predicting Behaviour in Groups Decision Tree:

1. individual contribution evaluated?
    

1. yes = social facilitation
    

1. subjectively easy task = better performance
    
2. subjectively challenging task = worse performance
    

3. no = social loafing
    

1. subjectively easy task = worse performance
    
2. subjectively challenging task = better performance
    

  

Group Decisions: groups do better if actively searching for best solution and listening to those with most expertise

Benefits: a main reason for forming groups is making better decisions, can outperform individuals

1. larger pool of knowledge 
    
2. check each others’ errors 
    
3. divide tasks
    

Outperform Individuals When:

1. tasks with clear correct answers
    
2. if defaulting to those with most information
    

Wisdom of Crowds: independent, diverse, decentralized opinions (allowed to answer in own way)

Disadvantages: 

Process Loss: aspects of group interaction inhibit good problem solving

-only do well if most talented member can convince others

1. Groupthink: maintaining group cohesion over good solutions, most likely in:
    

1. highly cohesive group (close)
    
2. isolated from other opinions
    
3. directive leader who makes opinions known
    

Symptoms: illusion of unanimity, belief in moral correctness, direct pressure on dissenters to conform

Ex: Challenger Space Ship Jan 28, 1986 

- NASA ignored challenges from engineers because directive leader
    
- all died
    

2. Group Polarization: groups make riskier/more extreme decisions than individuals would alone (in same direction as initial opinion) (Cautious or Risky Shift)![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/DdkTFD1YAR8YaDJpe7uD3fc-IpwvEwJ4JRu6uUteD-IwSHLBCVlZNTzak2gAFK7e59uLToqlyUVU7a_FdBEN3glm_BE8NabEAm-rwlwdeFIVj-66lGD5MYwuNHoVrA_BuUULQo59UmqwHudqFPUWE_c)
    

1. Persuasive Arguments Interpretation: arguments from each member
    
2. Social Comparison Interpretation: take position similar to others to be liked
    

4. Failure to Share Unique Information: repeat versions of original offerings instead of sharing new information/experiences (because supportive and compassionate conversationalists, validate at cost of sharing all information/better ideas
    

Larson (1998): 

1. 3-person physician teams diagnosing medical case, share some information but also have unique information
    
2. focusing only on shared information, not unique information
    

  

1. Transactional Leader: clear short-term goals rewarded when met
    
2. Transformational Leader: inspire focus on common long-term goals, better for wellbeing
    

Great Person Theory: key personality traits make some people good leaders

Contingency Theory of Leadership: characteristics of leader/group/situation determine quality of leadership

1. Task-Oriented Leader: job/task > member feelings/relationships
    
2. Relationship-Oriented Leader: job/task < member feelings/relationships
    

Gender and Leadership:![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/S8_hvWD9NsU9Znhg5KPqxlVUak-TI8SgRMCvulore2uPLaD-7EpS6LOin5txmXd98qE5rxnaSFmcYG60iSVOqMs-NoJwBL4ojKl2nITgw6BNeO2tvnSZqMDIIo3Rcfl193FF8fRqevaXaViZMf3xcVI)

-belief that good leaders have stereotypically male Agetic traits (dominant, aggressive) impedes women who are stereotyped to have Communal traits (warm, helpful)

-leaders of either gender are more compelling when conforming to gender norms

-women are put in change in more crisis scenarios where it is harder to succeed

  

Conflict and Cooperation:

Social Dilemmas: most beneficial individually if done by all will harm group

Increasing Cooperation: being friends, collectivist cultures, trust, individual to individual

Tit for Tat Strategy: responding way opponent did on previous trial

-consistently cooperating creates norm of cooperation benefitting everyone

Threats: not effective at reducing conflict

Negotiation: counteroffers until mutual agreement, require trust, better face to face

Integrative Solution: both make tradeoffs on things less important to them that are most important to others

  

Takeaway: groups can do better but have their own issues

  
  

Week 2: Methodology

  

Lecture Week 2:

  

Textbook Chapter 2: Methodology

  

Methodology:

Understanding Research Methods:

1. understand terminology and thought process of study
    
2. insight into conclusions we can draw
    
3. educated consumer research
    

Hindsight Bias: tendency to exaggerate predictability of events once they happen

- gift and curse of social psychology: course topics seem familiar, results seem obvious in retrospect (however intuitions are not always right)
    
- social psychology attempts to predict behaviour before occurs, not explain afterwards
    

Psychology: empirical science, believes most human behaviour can be scientifically studied, studied by testing hypothesis to construct theories

- science is not linear and straightforward process, continually evolves (contradictory theories, results, questions to refine ideas)
    

Building Process: iterative process between both theories and hypotheses

1. Theory: organized set of principles explaining an observed phenomena
    
2. Hypothesis: specific testable statement/idea about relationship between two variables/explanation for set of facts
    

- from everyday life or from dissatisfaction with current theories
    

Operational Definition: specifying how variables will be examined/measured/manipulated before testing (concrete so coding is consistent and future researchers could use)

  
![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/ZXsWp9FyeXwke_kMFzBzV55NQ0sZsQkMYas-73BfeaXh_fyUlD7NFPfXIW0EKgx2T2bYC6Aa1fK4hPnihgZBc1Jhtv6GtRsm54PvMBUoAQWQ_8P7nCm6btkTnsgwjewFlziKJTOlyFea24LW9nTQsbM)

Research Designs:

1. Observational Method: researcher observes group/specific behaviour in natural settings and systematic records behaviour
    

Goal: describe and measure behaviour in natural setting

- up close/immediate (do people talk to others on a bus)
    
- from a distance/at delay (experience sampling methods: send questions throughout day through technology)
    

EAR (Electronically Activated Recorder): new technology allows for naturalistic observation of everyday lives

- turns on randomly throughout the day, records ambient environment ~70-30s clips from 1 person a day
    

Advantages: unobtrusive, doesn’t rely on self-report (memory bias), reduces self-presentation concerns (do not know when on, realistic depictions of human behaviour)

- good first step in understanding real life behaviours in the world
    

- some behaviours hard to observe, code and measure reliably (motives, privacy)
    

1. Ethnography: observe group from the inside to understand complexity
    
2. Archival Analysis: examining cultural artifacts to understand culture’s values
    

2. Correlational Method: systematically measuring 2+ variables to assess degree of relation between them
    

Goal: measuring relation between variables, can only claim variables are related,

cannot claim causation

1. A causes B
    
2. B causes A (reverse causality)
    
3. C causes A and B (third-variable problem)
    

- provides measure of how well two variables relate
    

- correlation does not imply causation
    

Correlation Coefficient: measure of strength/direction of association between 2 variables of interest 

1.00 = perfect correlation/prediction (most in social psychology are 0.2-0.3)

0.00 = no correlation/prediction

1.  Positive Correlation: variables move in same direction
    
2. Negative Correlation: one goes up, other goes down
    
3. No Correlation: no relationship between variables
    

1. Surveys: representative samples are asked about attitudes and behaviours
    

- easy measure of attitudes and behaviours
    
- capture views of large groups via random selection and generalizability (Gallup World Poll, 140 countries, 95% of global adult population)
    

- gaining information difficult to observe, convenient, generalizable (if sampling representative segments)
    

- survey features/order of questions influence responses (high/low anchors, response options change responses)
    

Strack (1988): asked students are you happy? how many dates have you had in last month?

1. in that order no correlation (0.2)
    
2. flipped resulted in 0.66 correlation, reminded of dating failure and felt worse
    

Random Selection: ensuring representative sample by giving everyone in

population equal chance of being selected

3. Experimental Method: randomly assigned groups are given identical conditions except variable of interest, studied to learn independent variable effects, only method that can imply causation
    

Key Features:

1. identical conditions except variable of interest
    
2. random assignment (ensures groups are generalizable, instead of balancing groups allow randomness to cancel individual differences)
    

- allows researchers to investigate causality
    

- complicated to conduct, tradeoff of internal and external validity
    

Independent Variable: variable manipulated by researcher to measure effect

Dependent Variable: outcome variable measured by researcher to observe independent effects

Validity: tradeoff of control, need multiple experiments to address each kind

1. Internal Validity: extent we can be sure that only independent variable influenced outcome (so it must cause the effect), results from control
    

Random Assignment: all participants have equal chance of being in experimental or control group (individual differences cancel out)

Probability Level (p Value): number telling how likely results occurred by chance (statistically significant if less than 5/100 chances by chance)

2. External Validity: extent study results can be generalized across situations/people/practices (experiments rely on control, lead to risk of artificial results)
    

1. Situations:
    

1. Psychological Realism: experiment triggers similar psychological processes to real life events
    
2. Cover Story: give description of study different than true purpose
    

3. People:
    

1. Random Selection
    

Field Experiments: conducted in natural settings not lab

- increase external validity
    

- no random assignment, more extraneous variables
    

Basic Dilemma of Social Psychologist: tradeoff between internal and external

validity, usually not captured in a single experiment

  

Replication Crisis: repeating study with different populations/settings/methods to see if

similar results emerge

1. Direct: using original materials to copy original study
    
2. Conceptual: test same central idea with new/different methods
    

Goal: checking if findings are repeatable (true)

Do not happen often!

- incentives reward new, hard to publish, no grants/tenure/fame
    

Implications:

- once enters the literature there is minimal vetting, hard to remove mistakes can enter record and be used to shape policy, investments, our lives
    

Open Science Collaboration (group of 270+ researchers): attempt to replicate 100 findings in top psychology journals, chose key information to study, contacted original authors to get materials/check plans

- Significance: less than 50% of studies replicated (original = 95% significant, replication = 37%)
    
- Confidence Interval: 47% were within 95% interval from previous work
    

Explanations:

1. Fraud (yes but rare)
    
2. Real effect but from subtle features being ignored (known and unknown leading to false positives, need further study)
    
3. Chance (sometimes real findings don’t occur, highly unlikely this many)
    
4. Questionable Research Practices (QRPs) (researchers not trying to do outright fraud but small decisions/justifications add up to inflate error rates, no consistent methodology to deal with conditions)
    

Simmons, Nelson & Simonsohn (2011): flexibility facilitates interesting and significant results

- not fraud or malicious intent
    
- exploring data (desire to find statistically significant result, ambiguous practices/no right way to crunch data)
    
- all alone seem harmless, compounded can increase chances of error
    

Impossible Examples: 2 studies of chronological rejuvenation

1. assigned to listen to “when i’m 64” or kalimba, reported birthday and father’s age
    
2. people were happier and younger after listening to the Beatles
    

- capitalization on research degrees of freedom
    

QRPs Common: survey of 2,000 researchers self-report some QRPs ~60%

of time (not reporting all measures)

  

Replication Crisis:

- findings entering literature because of QRPs
    
- replications rare leaving false positives in record
    
- <50% of studies in top journals replicate
    
- psychology now alone, others followed with similar/worse rates of replication
    

Outcomes: science is long game

- errors are inevitable, science is self-correcting
    
- learn from mistakes and improve
    
- recommitment to truth/transparency
    

Building a Sturdier Science: new wide-scale attempts to improve sharing of research in journals

1. Valuing Replications (applauded, published in top journals in saved space)
    
2. Larger Samples (before studies could be published ~20/condition, now expectation for much larger for better estimate of population)
    
3. Posting Data: sharing anonymized data (online repositories, allows others to repeat analyses, explore data and see all measures and data properties)
    
4. Sharing Materials (online repository, easier replication, confirm all measures/conditions have been reported)
    
5. Pre-Registration (most game changing): publicly declare predictions in advance (date/time stamped, describes sample size, study design (IV/DV), analyses, researchers follow plans or explain deviations, removes researcher degrees of freedom)
    

Open Science Framework: online repository for materials, data, pre-registrations

- badges to display open data, open materials, preregistered to show meeting high standards
    

  

Meta-Analysis: averaging results of 2+ studies to see if IV effects are reliable

Basic Research: studying reasons for behaviour independently

Applied Research: studying to solve specific problems

  

New Methods:

1. Cross-Cultural Research Method: research conducted across cultures to test universality
    

-need to change methods so measuring same thing

2. Social Neuroscience: using biological feedback to understand social impacts
    

1. EEG: electrodes on scalp measuring brain activity
    
2. fMRI: scanner measuring changes in blood flow to brain
    

  

Ethical Issues: what may be upsetting for the individual is beneficial for the whole

Informed Consent: agreement based on full experiment understanding (often impossible)

Deception: participants misled about study purpose and events

Ethical Principles:

1. Respect for Dignity of Persons
    
2. Informed Consent (if possible)
    
3. Minimizing Harm
    
4. Freedom to Withdraw
    
5. Privacy and Confidentiality
    
6. Use of Deception (only if no other way)
    

Debriefing: at the end of study explain purpose and events

  

Week 3: Social Cognition (how do we make sense of the world)

  

Textbook Chapter 3: Social Cognition

  

Social Cognition: how people think select, interpret and use information to make decisions and judgements about the social world

1.  Automatic Thinking: effortless, unconscious, unintentional, involuntary analysis, rely upon a lot of the time, allow us to react to environment quickly

- like autocorrect, fast, based on past experience, often useful, correct, efficient, sometimes fails and is awkward and incorrect
    

1. Schemas (huge influence): mental structures organizing knowledge about the social world
    

Benefits:

- helpful guides directing behaviour, give baseline for interpretation, fill in blanks in ambiguous situations (give us script for how to behave)
    
- can shape what we see, remember, behave/react
    
- turns vague/ambiguous stimuli into ordered information easier to recall
    
- schemas for events, groups, specific people, yourself
    

Issues:

1. Shape what we see/fill in blanks
    

Guest Lecturer Study: gives 20 minute talk in economics class, students before given cold or warm description, if they expected them to be warm reported they were warmer, if cold, colder (saw what they expected to see)

2. Stereotypes: schemas applied to groups to generalize how members think or act 
    

- wrongly informing assumptions about other people
    

Shooting Study: quickly see white or black man holding gun or cell phone, more people shoot unarmed black man due to schemas about black men as threatening, same number of errors for armed and unarmed white men

Amadou Diallo: mistaken for rapist on the loose, went to show ID and shot 41 times

3. Shape what we remember:
    

- memory is reconstructive, we remember bits of information and fill in the rest based on schemas and expectations
    

Jack Barbara Vacation Study: given story about couple’s ski vacation, one condition Jack proposed, one he sexually assaulted Barbara, 2 weeks later memory test with series of statements true/false, determine what was in original story, misremembered facts consistent with schemas (fill in blanks with what makes sense with romance or assault)

4. Influence how we behave: get what we expect
    

Self-Fulfilling Prophecy: we act in accordance with our expectations

which influences how others react (fulfill our expectations)

Bloomers Study: did IQ test on elementary students, told teachers

who the “bloomers” were who did well (actually random), end of year “bloomers” scored better on IQ tests, gave bloomers more challenging material, better feedback/support helping children

bloom

5. Schema Selection:
    

Accessibility: how accessible a schema is in the mind influences use,

must be accessible and applicable to influence

1. Long-term, familiar reminders (chronic exposure)
    
2. Relevant to current goals
    
3. Recent exposure: primed
    

Priming: recent experiences influence schema accessibility

Donald Description Study: primed with positive or negative words,

react to description and rate behaviours based on priming

- prompted by benign/inconsequential triggers
    

Priming with Heat: John Bargh (Yale), cold beverage makes you have

negative impression of other

6. Schema Durability: remain even when proven wrong
    

Suicide Note Study: read 25 notes, determine if real or fake, told

they were good or bad at task (24/25 v. 10/25 fake feedback),

predicted future success at task because incorporate feedback into

schema (activates schema about sensitivity and intuitiveness),

effects last even when told results were fake

Perseverance Effect: beliefs persist even after original supporting evidence is discredited (people find additional support and use this additional information, schemas are already active and supporting belief, really hard to override or change)

2. Heuristics (more precise scenario-based): mental shortcuts making decision making faster, discrete and contained
    

1. Availability Heuristic: make judgements based on how easily something comes to mind (vivid examples are easier to remember), can be correct but can also be wrong
    

Schwarz Assertiveness Study: one group wrote 6 times they acted assertively, one group wrote 12, then assessed level of assertiveness, 12 group thought less assertive because harder to come up with 12, 6 group thought more because easier to recall

2. Representativeness: classify events by similarity to typical case (used more than base rates), can be helpful and correct but ignores base rate information
    

Base Rate Information: information about frequency of different categories

in the population

3. Anchoring and Adjustment: mental shortcut where we start with a figure/estimate in mind and adjust up or down from this point (often fail to adjust as much as possible)
    

3. Embodied Cognition: body sensations can activate schemas
    

Cultural Differences:

-content of schemas influenced by culture

Analytic Thinking Style (Western): focus on object properties over context

Holistic Thinking Style (East Asian): focus on overall context and relationships

-may be influence of city/environment that primes this

  

2. Controlled Thinking: conscious, effortful, voluntary, requires mental energy, occupies mind (one topic at a time), can be turned on or off

- believing in free will makes people more helpful and less immoral
    

1. Counterfactual Thinking: mentally changing past to imagine what might have been, most likely when just miss a desired outcome
    

(if I hadn’t done __ then I could have ___)

- worse wellbeing
    

- learn how to improve future actions (if not perfectionist)
    

Medalists: silver medalist less happy (I could have won gold), bronze medalist happy (At least I got a medal)

2. Thought Suppression: attempt to avoid thinking about something a person would prefer to forget (bad breakup, tempting ice cream)
    

Two-Part Process: more difficult under cognitive load (tired, upset, hungry), operating system wares down so left only with monitoring system

1. Monitoring System: searches for unwanted thoughts
    
2. Operating System: distracts from unwanted thoughts
    

- when someone tries not to think about idea/object is comes to mind more
    

White Bear Study: directed to verbalize stream of consciousness, conditions: initial expression (think of white bear), then suppression and initial suppressions (NO white bear), then expression, ring bell when think of white bear, if trying to suppress initially, people thought of white bear way more

Overconfidence Barrier: people think they have more accurate judgment than they do

-to combat this consider an opposing point of view

Week 4: Social Perception (how do we make sense of each other)

  

Textbook Chapter 4: Social Perception

  

Social Perception: how we form impressions and make inferences about others

- extremely common human behaviour
    

1. Nonverbal Communication: how people communicate without words

- intentional and unintentional
    
- facial expressions (biggest factor), gestures, eye gaze, body position
    

Emblems: well understood nonverbals with a clear meaning within a culture

1. for communication
    
2. eliciting empathy (we mimic actions/gestures of others)
    

Mirror Neurons: fire when we (and others) perform an action

3. substitute for verbal message
    

1. Emotional Expressions
    

Facial Expression: crown jewel of nonverbal communication, 6 universally recognized basic facial expressions 

Darwin: facial expressions are species specific, universally encoded and decoded the same way regardless of cultural differences

- remnants of useful body reactions (disgust facial expression is intended to deter you from gross stuff, repels noxious stimulus (closes eyes, closes nostrils, expelling from mouth))
    

Encode: express/emit nonverbals

Decode: interpret nonverbals

6 Major Expressions Universally: Ekman and Freisen

- traveled around the world and showed participants photos of facial expressions paired with scenarios, most people could correctly identify them  
    

1. Happiness (>82%)
    
2. Sadness
    
3. Anger
    
4. Surprise (can be confused with fear)
    
5. Fear (>54%)
    
6. Disgust (>44%)
    

Other Universal Expressions?

-also social interaction emotions like contempt, pride, embarrassment, anxiety, shame, guilt

7. Embarrassment
    
8. Pride (expand chest and arms up)
    

Debate:

- some things are culture specific
    

-some cultural differences (contextual dependency)

- Western: only focus on focal character

- East Asian: context changes assessment of focal character emotions

Difficulties:

1. Affect Blend: different face parts showing different emotions at once
    
2. Display Rules: cultural rules of what nonverbal signals are appropriate (within gender and culture)
    

Variations: vary by culture, intimacy (close talker), 

Canada/US = 0.5m bubble, Eastern cultures = smaller bubble

- Collectivist: less strong emotion expression, group harmony is priority
    
- Gender: men more powerful emotions, women more powerless emotions
    

  

2. Micro-Expressions: fleeting facial expressions (40ms-0.5s)
    

- true emotions sneaking out, easiest to detect in slow motion, some people are better than others, improves with practice
    
- when people are trying to mask or control true emotions
    

  

3. Thin Slices of Behaviour: power of non-verbal expression/body language
    

- can pick up a lot of information accurately and quickly using nonverbals from 6 seconds of footage
    

Power of Nonverbal Perception (Ambady & Rosenthal, 1993): participants watched 3 2 second silent clips of teachers, asked to rate teachers on dimensions included in course evaluations, compared assessments with assessments of students 

- 6 seconds of footage were enough for participants to assess 11/16 measures strongly correlated to student evaluations (likeability: r=0.72)
    

Interpreting Correlation Size:

- typical score in psychology: r=0.30
    
- large correlation: r=0.60
    

Alternative Explanations?

- female teachers may be interpreted more warmly
    
- demand effects (idea of what researchers are testing)
    
- only correlational
    

Speed Dating: short 1-2 minute talks with partners, end of night check off

who you liked, exchange contact information, actually may be long enough

to make accurate first impression

  

Challenges of Email/Text: removing nonverbals

Email Study (Kruger, Epley, Parker, NG, 2005): participants asked to communicate

one randomly assigned topic with emotion (sarcasm, sadness, anger, serious) with

face-to-face (audio and nonverbal), voice (audio only) and email (no audio or

nonverbal), asked to predict accuracy of message

- accuracy improved when they had some nonverbal information
    
- every method people overestimated how well participant understood message, biggest gap in expected v. real in email and voice
    
- true for friends and strangers
    

  
  

2. Filling in the Blanks: using nonverbal cues (facial expressions, body posture, gestures) to understand others

- can identify class/sexuality by face at above chance levels
    
- more attractive = assumed to be morally good and successful
    

1. Implicit Personality Theory: schemas used to group personality traits, assume certain traits go together, applied to people, often big help in understanding quickly what others are broadly about, but come with costs 
    

- “what is beautiful is good” stereotype: assume attractive people are good people
    
- collectivist: less likely to stereotype success from attractiveness
    

- different implicit personality theories across cultures, language forms impressions
    

  

3. Causal Attribution: figuring out why people do what they do![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/-_cUSPvhTI6RI66f7O-yX3A1DahxlHe2yxcSQi5QrjiJUwkLWTKu_7m6zAAEoRTKNpmpsHrmCar9dn5Z0XaPDVnfDr019uMEHc2ZL6uZLyQ03fcf3mmA38Sw-2OWQSzVYArq2u3S8vPr1xVSGVxHu9E)

  

1. Attribution Theory: how people explain the causes of their own and others’ behaviour
    

- going beyond implicit personality theories to answer the “why” question
    
- started by Fritz Heider (1958), often act like naive scientists and try to determine the causes of actions
    

1. Internal Attributions: within the person (actions reflect personality/disposition), default to this in Western cultures
    
2. External Attribution: outside the person (actions reflect situation/context)
    

  

Covariation Model: to form attributions we examine patterns of behaviour/causes

between actors and stimuli 

1. Consensus Information: how other actors react to same stimulus (not used as much)
    
2. Distinctiveness Information: how same actor responds to other stimuli
    
3. Consistency Information: frequency of behaviour between same actor and stimuli
    

  

2. Correspondence Bias/Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE): tendency to infer that someone’s behaviour corresponds to personality (who they always are)
    

- overestimate internal factors, underestimate external factors, focus on subject not context (because it is often invisible to us)
    
- error because people are often reacting to world/context 
    
- not always wrong, but general tendency to overlook power of the situation, failing to notice how situations influence our and others’ behaviour
    

Fundamental Attribution Error Castrp Essay Study(Jones & Harris, 1967): participants read essay for or against Fidel Castro, half told authors picked stance (represented views), half told they were assigned topic (not representing views), asked to assess how much authors supported Castro?

- when told had choice assume opinion of essay reflects actual opinions, participants told no choice make very similar predictions (forget context)
    

Katie Videos: don’t always use FAE, context can change how we measure traits

(difficult topics meant nervous behaviour is excused) 

Gilbert, Pelham, Krull (1988): participants see video of woman behaving anxiously,

told different situations (anxiety-provoking topics, neutral topics) and given

cognitive busyness manipulation (busy: rehearse topics, not busy: no rehearsal)

- when people are cognitively busy/distracted they do not take situation into account and assume behaviour reflects personality
    
- when people are not cognitively busy they adjust assessments for situation (take context into account when assessing anxiousness in video)
    

Two-Stage Model: automatic internal attribution, then potential conscious external

attribution (often skipped)

1. Effortless Dispositional Attribution: default mode, occurs when busy
    
2. Effortful Correction: to account for situation (takes cognitive effort)
    

- collectivist: less prone, more situational attribution
    
- western: more prone, more dispositional attribution
    

  

1. evolutionary benefits? easier to remember who is threatening by assuming actions reflect personality (actually no because cultural differences in FAE, more pervasive in Western cultures than East Asian cultures)
    
2. Perceptual Salience: focus of attention is what we assume is cause of behaviour, importance overestimated
    

- in North America we are focused on actor so assume they are responsible
    

Perceptual Salience Study Taylor and Fiske: 2 participants

(confederates) have a scripted conversation in middle of room, 6

real participants around them (2 have best view of A, 2 best view of

B, 2 can see both), after each participant rated how much each

participant was involved in conversation, area of focus predicted

how much they assessed involvement (who they were watching was

reason/driver of conversations)

- whatever we are attending to is what we see as cause of behaviour (for others: focus on them, for us: focus on world)
    

  

Actor/Observer Difference: attribute others’ behaviour to internal factors

(disposition), own behaviour to external causes (context/situation)

- exception to FAE is recognize situational influence of own behaviour
    

  

1. Self-Serving Attributions: desire to hold positive self view changes attributions, attribute success to internal, failure to external, take praise and deflect blame
    

- departure from actor/observer difference, normally self attributions are situational 
    

- strongest in US, Western countries, Africa, Eastern Europe, Russia
    
- Asia low or absent, attribute success to others and failure to self
    

2. Defensive Attributions: explanations for behaviour to avoid feelings of vulnerability/mortality
    
3. Belief In A Just World: bad things happen to bad people, good things happen to good people
    

- people will think irrationally to keep this belief
    

4. Bias Blind Spot: thinking others are more susceptible to attributional biases than we are
    

  

Midterm (25%):

- focus on studies covered in class
    
- 20 multiple choice (0.5 points each)
    
- 2 short answer questions (total of 16 points) (scenario, name/theory phenomenon, describe it and provide experimental evidence of it)
    

Stage 1: 60min to write exam independently

Stage 2: 25 minutes to answer same multiple choice questions again with group of 3-4 others (90% personal, 10% group)

  

Week 5: Attitudes and Attitude Change

  

Textbook Chapter 6: Attitudes and Attitude Change

  

1. Attitudes: evaluations of people, objects and ideas (we evaluate most things we encounter)

3 Components:

1. Affective: based on feelings and emotions (values, sensory/aesthetic experiences)
    

1. not from rational examination
    
2. not governed by logic
    
3. linked to values (efforts to change attitudes challenge values)
    

3. Cognitive: based on beliefs about object’s properties (pros and cons) (easier to describe if many things)
    
4. Behavioural: based on observations of own behaviour (don’t know how feeling until see own actions)
    

  

1. Explicit: consciously endorse, reportable, based on recent experience
    
2. Implicit: unconscious, involuntary, uncontrollable, based on childhood experiences
    

  

Attitudes and Behaviour Prediction:

1. Spontaneous Behaviour: attitudes only predict behaviour when highly accessible (more direct experience)
    
2. Planned Behaviour: best predictor is intention which is determined by
    

1. Attitudes (more specific = better predictor)
    
2. Subjective Norms (how people close to us will react/view behaviour)
    
3. Perceived Behavioural Control (believed ease of performance)
    

- Western: personal attitudes better predictor, norms influential in both
    

2. Attitudes and Persuasion:![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/O3FbjITgDUs6OABYVl_koPUA4pkMxsgdsrqXMjUN8sJuG-SxY2eduvd06qgCfFODJtzBjKgpk-oeG84PzLbokVVYGZppYpnbKC_6JPjfHS29mQEv0I-OgKBKQiB1fAiLNwlGmCKnPvO2IQarOBhOIk0)

Persuasive Communication: advocates for one side of an issue

  

Yale Attitude Change Approach: “who said what to whom” 3 dimensions, may things influence persuasion success (early model for understanding influence)

1. Who? speaker
    
2. What? content of message
    
3. Whom? listener
    

Elaboration Likelihood Model: 2 routes of persuasion to create attitude change, effective in different contexts, convinced by different informaiton![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/4-bPEPHOXOK0zHJHt1p8nWhmIdKhBSqz0xux3luJ6K6KCIcX4BOSw9mgChkx3ymkP3xp61Ou1vLpHUHm244GDjGDubcW7HK43wtEByQwgDJGUClO4Rqt_ZpneNq9GQsxI9RFfhBg-WnbNKHaCAOnRsU)

1. Central Route: (when relevant and can pay attn) assume audience is motivated, care what you’re talking about, persuaded by good information/facts
    

When to use: when audience cares, attentive, concentrating, have cognitive capacity available

Characteristics: think carefully and deliberately about content, examine logic and evidence

- persuasion by thinking about facts/arguments, longer lasting, when messaging is clear and audience is alert
    
- longer term attitude change (persuaded of an idea using either central or peripheral route, after 10 days only central retained attitude)
    

2. Peripheral Route: (when not relevant/less attn) less invested/concerned with topic, persuaded by superficial characteristics
    

When to use: uninterested, tired, no cognitive resources

Characteristics: pay attention to superficial aspects, use simple cues, rules of thumb (length of arguments and status of speaker)

- persuasion by superficial cues, weaker, when audience is bored, tired or distracted
    
- shorter term attitude change
    

Comprehensive Exam Study: group of students read arguments for comprehensive exam at end of degree, varied 3 factors to see what route was used

1. relevance (implemented now v. in 10 years)
    
2. argument strength (strong v. weak points)
    
3. source of argument (credible source Carnegie Mellon Advisory committee or high school students)
    

- when argument was personally relevant use central route, swayed by argument strength (not speaker/length), when not personally relevant use peripheral route, focus on length/status of speaker and not argument quality
    

Fear Arousing Communication: attempting to persuade by eliciting fear

-only works when next steps are also offered and is not too scary to make people shut down

  

3. Resisting Persuasive Messages:

  

1. Knowledge:
    

- shift attitude less 
    

- scrutinize messages more (knowledge of persuasion intention decreases effectiveness)
    
- better able to develop counter-arguments
    

  

2. Attitude Inoculation: becoming immune to attitude change from small exposures to opposing views
    

- introduce small attack on belief, refute the attack with counter-arguments, more resistant to later, stronger attacks
    

  

3. Reactance Theory: when people feel their freedom is challenged, they experience a negative reactance state and distance themselves from threatening behaviour
    

Reactance: don't like to feel like their freedom is threatened (push back against)

  

Subliminal Persuasion:

Subliminal Persuasion Study: participants required to not eat/drink anything for 3 hours before study, allowed to have cookies at study, some allowed to drink, some not allowed to think, exposed to thirst-related prime and neutral prime, “taste test” of drink measured how much they drank

- not thirsty (allowed to drink) = no difference based on thirst prime
    
- thirsty (not allowed to drink) = big difference based on thirst prime (drank more)
    

Issues:

- in lab prime immediately precedes behaviour
    
- never been evidence of prime making people do something they are opposed to 
    

  

-best to target attitude by what aspect it is based in (fight fire with fire)

-cultural influence (collectivist v. individualist messaging)

Subliminal Messages: not consciously perceived but impacting judgements, attitudes and behaviours

-no evidence supporting this in everyday life, only in very specific lab conditions

  

4. Cognitive Dissonance: feeling of discomfort caused by holding two conflicting cognitions or conflicting cognition and behaviour, motivates change in cognition or behaviour to reduce conflict

- importance of FREE-CHOICE (if forced, no need for cognitive dissonance)
    

Resolutions:

- change thoughts (reduce dissonance)
    
- change behaviours (reduce dissonance)
    
- make special exception (excuse dissonance)
    

  

The Inspiration (“When Prophecy Fails”) (Festinger et al. 1956): heard there was a local group convinced that a UFO was coming and the world would be destroyed, joined group to observe behaviour, group was led to believe the UFO would escort them to spacecraft at midnight, in preparation they remove all metal

- no visitors at 12:05am, another clock says 11:55 so not yet
    
- 4:45am no visitor, leader says it has been called off, the little group has spread so much light that God saved the world from destruction
    

Evaluating Cult Members: “they’re crazy” but actually demonstrated underlying cognitive process in regular people, think about situation

  

The Classic Study (Festinger & Carlsmith, 1959): instructed participants to do dull task (turn pegs a quarter turn) for 1 hour, when leaving participant is told to tell next participant the task was enjoyable (studying performance when come in cold or told is enjoyable), because confederate isn’t here, paid $1 or $20, report liking or disliking from -5 to 5.

- participants paid $1 reported liking it way more than people paid $20
    
- $20 had good external justification (did it for money)
    
- $1 didn’t have good external justification ($1 isn’t much, had to justify it by retroactively inflate task enjoyment)
    

  

Recent Replication (May 21, 2011 - day of rapture): Preacher Harold Camping predicted the world would end with big earthquake, date came and went, preacher updated his prediction to future date saying calculations were incorrect (again in october 2011 and april 2018)

  

The Grasshopper Study (Zimbardo et al., 1964): participants rate initial attitudes towards disliked or disgusting foods (snakes, eels, grasshopper, etc), asked to eat 5 fried grasshoppers (but told they do not have to) but he would like them to, in some the experimenter was nice, in some was a jerk (but always professional and organized)

- researcher personality did not affect whether people ate grasshoppers but attitudes changed
    
- nice experimenter: no attitude change (clear external justification as favour to nice guy)
    
- nasty experimenter: more pro-grasshopper (because little external justification so had to change attitudes to like grasshoppers)
    

  

Questioning Cognitive Dissonance Theory:

- is any 2 conflicting cognitions enough to cause cognitive dissonance
    

Modern Revision: inconsistencies that threaten core sense of self cause dissonance (Eliot Aronson) (for Westerners, not universal)

  

Cognitive Dissonance Theory: Critical Examination 

Heine & Lehman (1997): Canadian and Japanese students visiting Vancouver, task to rate 10 CDs from most to least favourite, got to pick between option 5 and 6, then rate them again

- Canadian students rated CD they got higher in second assessment (changing beliefs to match actions)
    
- Japanese students had no change in ranking
    

  

Hoshino-Browne et al. (2005): Euro-Canadians and East Asians rating food items/gift cards, got to take 5th or 6th choice home (for self or friend), following choice rerate items

- Euro-Canadians rated pick higher when picking for self
    
- East-Asian rated pick higher when picking for others
    

  

- universal but situations the provoke it change
    

  

Postdecision Dissonance: discomfort after making choice between two attractive choices so reduce attractiveness of other option and enhance value of choice

Post-Decision Dissonance: aroused after making decision by what we could have had (and lost) by making choice

- reduced by enhancing attractiveness of choice made and devaluing alternative
    
- more permanent decision = greater need to reduce dissonance
    
- acting immorally causes more immoral acts in the future (values change to justify actions)
    

  

Applications & Unfortunate Outcomes:

1. permanent decisions make us more confident (can’t change mind so feel sure to reduce dissonance) (people who make bet are more confident after placing bet than before)
    
2. think happier with item with 30-day exchange window, cognitive dissonance predicts liking final sale better
    

  

3. Justification of Effort: tendency to increase liking for something you’ve worked hard to attain 
    
4. Rationalization Trap: potential dissonance reduction outcome, justifying one harmful or stupid act allows the next and causes chain of events
    

- justify punitive and hurtful acts (rather than apologize)
    
- see bad actions, come to dislike target (they deserved it)
    

  

Persuasion: changing thoughts can change behaviour

Cognitive Dissonance: changing bahaviour can change thoughts

  

5. Counterattitudinal Behaviour: acting in opposite ways to private beliefs
    

1. External Justification: reason for dissonant behaviour is outside individual
    
2. Internal Justification: reducing dissonance by changing self (attitudes)
    

-harsh punishment = more effort to not get caught (compliance, not attitude change)

-mild punishment = changing internal justification

Insufficient Punishment: lack sufficient external justification for resisting activity, results in devaluing avoided act

-learn to dislike/hate/dehumanize someone we hurt to justify it to ourselves (cruelty escalation)

Hypocrisy Induction: making people aware of hypocrisy (dissonance between actions and external beliefs)

- reduces dissonant behaviour
    

Self Affirmation Theory: reduce dissonance by focusing on competence in unrelated areas

-high self esteem = not as tempted to cheat (would be dissonant with self-concept)

-may be only Western cultures feeling dissonant (concerned with individual attitudes and identity), East Asian feel dissonance when making/justifying choices made for others

  

Week 7(8): Culture

  

Lecture Week 8

  

Culture: collection of discrete behavioural norms and cognitions shared by people within population that are distinct from those of another population (bow v. handshake)

- everywhere, affects us every day
    
- can be hard to identify until compared to another culture, all encompassing so hard to detect
    

Why Study Culture:

- participants in most psychology studies are female North American psychology undergraduates (The psychology of the Psych 101 student), seen in top journals
    
- Journal of Personality and Social Psychology (92% NA authors, 96% participants from Western, industrialized countries)
    

WEIRD: Western Educated Industrialized Rich Democratic

- only 12% of world population are WEIRD, limits more understanding of humans broadly, do we really understand human behaviour or of a small subset?
    

  

Muller-Lyer Illusion: people raised in Western cultures see figure A as longer than figure B, mainly applies to people who grew up in man-made environments with corners (open corner closer, forward-facing corner father away, judge different for safety)

  

Cultural Psychology: psychology trying to understand how environment and surroundings influence human psychology, allows us to do 4 things

- need to study more than WEIRD samples to understand human behaviour
    

1. Test cross-cultural generality of a theory (is theory/observation true in all cultures?)
    
2.  Discover human universals (observations seen in all places around the world, specifics will vary but core features universal)
    
3. Discover relationship between culture and mind (cyclical process of feedback)
    
4. Discover unique psychological experiences or phenomena in a culture (Amae (positive and dependent love like parent child bond) emotion in Japan that doesn’t exist in NA, Schadenfreude (take pleasure in someone else’s pain) in Germany that doesn’t exist in NA)
    

  

Cultural Influences:

1. Conceptualization of the Self:
    

Self-Concepts:

1. Independent Self-Concept: encouraged in high-individualism cultures (default in USA and Can)
    

- important for people to see traits and preferences as stable, value consistency and stability over contexts, expect people to be the same in all contexts
    
- see ourselves as distinct and different from other people even close relations
    
- feel autonomous even in relations to others, we are individual self-contained person operating in the same way no matter context
    

2. Interdependent Self-Concept: encouraged in highly collectivist cultures (default in East Asia)
    

- traits and preferences depend on context and who is around you
    
- who you are is contextually dependent, flexible
    
- less of a boundary between us and others, feel connected to others, relations with others are central to identity, define yourself by who you’re with
    
- interactions with others shape who we are 
    

  

2. Perceptions of the World
    

1. Analytic Thinking: (pieces of puzzle) thinking focusing on properties of objects without considering surrounding context, parallel with independent self-concept
    

- common in Western cultures (Canada, US, Europe)
    
- focus on object and attributes to explain and categorize events
    

Attribute: feature that does not involve context

2. Holistic Thinking: (connection to whole) thinking focusing on overall context and ways in which things relate, parallel with interdependent self-concept
    

- common in Eastern cultures (Japan, China, Korea)
    
- focus on object in context
    
- pay attention to relationships between context and objects to explain and categorize objects
    

Grad Student Goes Beserk: physics grad student applied for award

competition, unsuccessfully appealed it, subsequently failed to get an academic

job, on October 31, 1991 he entered the University of Iowa Physics Department

where he was a student and shot his advisor, the person who denied his appeal,

several students and bystanders and then himself

Morris and Peng (1994): compared newspaper descriptions of event to understand

different worldviews on event

- World Journal (leading Chinese) and New York Times (leading English)
    
- looking at how student and event were describes and if explanations for event and who/what is to blame differed
    

Dispositional: very bad temper, sinister edge to character, darkly disturbed man

Situational Situations: did not get along with advisor, isolation from community, availability of guns in US

- World Journal described event in more situational terms (larger context around individual), New York Times more dispositional (about personal attributes, FAE)
    
- similar findings in other non-social categorization tasks (not just nicer authors)![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/QQ4eojBbzlSH7FMg4ZxRXEUsC_wOvBSBcBctHESOeHKfBHfAl0V-ALWrchqzzDF6IoCbOzTdyNaqIZEWyHi5JpSSFsJZc055cR3EoxPIBR4Y65kOOAKhBRXP8cxZV0oTboSqaggH0Gm586l3AukFQhM)
    

  

3. Preferences
    

1. Preferences for Emotion: culturally dependent
    

Ideal Affect: preferred emotional state

-similar (everyone wants positive emotions), different (level of arousal associated with positive states differs)

Affect:

1. Valence: positive or negative
    
2. Arousal: high or low
    

- ideal affect in Western is high arousal, ideal in East Asian in low arousal
    

  

Affective Valuation Theory (AVT): illustrates how different emotions manifest in different ways in relation to arousal

- calmness, serenity, restfulness v. excitement, enthusiasm, elation
    
- manifest in music, drugs, children’s books and religion
    

Music: looked at top hits across cultures, in East Asia top hits were calming, in NA more high energy and high arousal 

Drug Use: East Asia popular drugs are sedative/calming, NA preference for uppers (cocaine) elated/ecstatic

Children’s Books: characters in East Asian are calm, in NA are excited and high arousal

Religion: East Asian aims towards calmness, serenity, restfulness, NA religion aims towards excitement, enthusiasm, elation

2. Preferences for Uniqueness:
    

- independent cultures: uniqueness is valued, think outside the box
    
- interdependent cultures: conformity is values, that nail that stands out is pounded down
    

Study by Heejung Kim and Hazel Markus (1999): recruited NA or EA participants to select between common and uncommon items

- asked to complete questionnaire in exchange for pen
    
- reached into bag and grabbed pens, pens either orange or green, made sure always a distribution, pick between common and uncommon colour of pen
    
- NA strongly prefer the unique pens (signaling uniqueness), EA prefer dominant pen colour (conform)
    

- many cultures unexplored (africa, latin america, middle east)

- need to explore more than just collectivist and individualist tendencies

  

Culture and Causal Cognition:

East Asian: consider context and disposition when making attributions, holistic thinking style

Western: just consider disposition when making attributions, analytic thinking style

  

Measures of Personality:

1. Entity Theory: behaviour is result of fixed traits (American)
    
2. Incremental Theory: behaviour is result of situational context (Koreans)
    

  

Field Dependence: relative difficulty in separating object from environment

  

1. Analytic Cognition: categorizing object by attributes and explaining with rules of category
    

- favoured by Ancient Greeks 
    
- dependent on keeping animals, trading, fishing (farming not possible), more individualism 
    

2. Holistic Cognition: oriented towards field context of object, explain in relation to field
    

- favoured by Ancient Chinese
    
- had large scale farming centuries before Europe which required cooperation
    

  

WEIRD Paper:

- cross cultural differences in visual perception, analytic reasoning, fairness, cooperation, memory, heritability of IQ
    

WEIRD: Western Educated Industrialized Rich Democratic

- most (96%) of studies of this group, only 12% of population
    
- differences come from adapting to diverse culturally constructed environments
    

Making Research More Credible:

- push research to support generalizations with evidence
    
- give researchers credit for considering diverse pools
    
- prioritize cross-disciplinary, cross-cultural research with grants
    
- evaluate findings across populations
    

  

Week 9: Conformity and Norms

  

Textbook Chapter 4: Conformity and Norms

  

Conformity: behaviour change as a result of real or imagined influence of others

- can override survival behaviours, impacts interpretation of reality, not inherently good or bad (especially bad reputation in NA cultures who believe we should be discrete and unchangeable beings, in EA cultures enforced)
    
- unaware of how much we do this
    

1. Informational Social Influence (ISI): conforming in ambiguous situations because we belief others’ interpretations are more correct/other people know how to behave in context, motivated by desire to get information (private acceptance and public compliance)
    

- very helpful when we don’t know what is going on
    
- more high stakes the outcome, more we follow what other people are doing (responding to siren in foreign country)
    

Sherif Autokinetic Study (dot on the wall): asked ps to sit in dark room, look at dot of light projected on wall (actually not moving but looks like it is due to eye jiggling), estimates ranged from 2.5cm to 25cm. Did it first by themselves, then come into lab and talk to others who did experiment, share estimates, ps came back a few days later and completed task with 2 other people, as trials increased responses converged on similar answer, ps came back weeks later and gave estimates close to group estimates, proves private acceptance and public compliance

Most Common:

1. Ambiguous Situations: increased uncertainty increases relying on others’ reactions
    
2. Crisis: no time to stop and think/behave rationally, high stakes
    
3. Expertise (when expert is present): makes others more valued as guide for correct reactions, conform to recommendations of other because we think they know better
    

Private Acceptance: genuine belief one is correct leads to conformity

Public Compliance: doing what other people do, desire to fit in socially leads to

conformity regardless of genuine belief

2. Normative Social Influence (NSI): change behaviour in order to be liked or accepted by other people (public compliance not private acceptance)
    

- why? we are social creatures, we need companionship, feel more likely to be accepted if we are similar to others in group we want to be accepted into
    

- deviants are blocked, ignored and outcast
    

Asch Line Length Study: 7 confederates and 1 real p (near end) seated around table, told participating in a study about perception, told that will see one standard line and decide which comparison line it matches, go around table and call out number of matching line, always one clear answer at each trial, always responded in same order so p heard many other answers before answering, as went on Asch introduced critical task of all confederates giving wrong response

- 76% conformed at least once, began resisting and conformed as trials went on (worn down)
    
- 99% accuracy when alone (in some versions of study they wrote down answers or completed it alone), proves people know correct response just choosing not to give it (public compliance but no private acceptance)
    
- people didn’t want to disagree or risk embarrassment and isolation (even from strangers)
    

  

Social Norms: implicit and explicit rules for behaviour, values and beliefs for members

- types of norms typically go hand in hand but sometimes differ
    

1. Injunctive Norm: rules about how people are supposed to behave (please don’t litter, don’t park here, pick up after your dog signs that are not always followed)
    
2. Descriptive Norm: how people actually behave
    

  

Social Impact Theory: whether people will conform to social influence depends on the strength, immediacy and number of people in group

1. Strength: how important group is to person (group of friends, club
    
2. Immediacy: proximity in space and time (in-person v. email, phone, text or today v. in future)
    
3. Number: size of group, larger the group, more the sway (levels off at 6-7)
    

Other factors:

4. Unanimity: resisting is hardest when everyone agrees but you (having one ally (even if not exactly the same but also disagreeing with group) decreases conformity, in Asch study conformity dropped from 32% to 6%)
    
5. Gender (women are more likely to conform publicly, no difference privately)
    
6. Collectivist Culture (more conformity to important group, less to strangers)
    

- Hunting Culture: individualist
    
- Farming Culture: collectivist
    

  

Overcoming Conformity:

- can be very helpful for organizing/coordinating social life, streamline social interactions 
    
- can be negative, spread incorrect information
    

Consequences of Resistance:

- others will try to bring us back in line 
    
- continued resistance leads to rejection
    

Overcoming:

1. awareness of conformity pressures
    
2. finding an ally or group to resist with you (even if not same opinion, just another dissenter)
    
3. cash in your Idiosyncrasy Credits: credits earned from conforming to group norms before allow you to deviate on occasion
    

  

In Everyday Life:

1. women’s body image: exposure to thinness in media leads to negative body satisfaction, eating disorders
    

- food scarce cultures: plump = beautiful
    
- food reliable cultures: thin = beautiful
    

2. men’s body image: exposure to muscularity leads to negative body satisfaction (and more desire for female thinness), dangerous dieting and substances
    

Minority Influence: minority influences beliefs and behaviours of majority when view is consistent over time and others agree (informational social influence)

  

Persuasion: 

Compliance: change of behaviour as result of direct request from another

1. Door-In-The-Face Technique: large request first (expecting refusal), then small reasonable request, only works once/short term
    

- comply because feel like they are doing us a favour by lessening request
    

Chaperone Study: trying to recruit people to chaperone group of troubled teens

on zoo trip, control condition: given direct request to chaperone trip of delinquent

youth to zoo on field trip, 17% said yes, experimental condition: ask if would take

on 2 year unpaid juvenile worker position that everybody said no to, how about 2

hour chaperoning trip to zoo, increased to 51% said yes

Reciprocity Norm: return favour when someone does something nice for you

- smaller request is something nice, so we need to return favour
    

Downside: people are not likely to comply again, reciprocity norm fulfilled and no

reason to help in future

2. Foot-In-The-Door Technique: small request first (most will accept), then larger request, longer term compliance
    

- comply because change in self-perception (we are someone who helps/sympathetic to cause, catch dissonance of actions so behave in accordance)
    

Drive Safely Sign Study: control group only asked to put large, unattractive drive

safely sign on front lawn, just under 20% said yes, experimental group were first

approached with small request to sign petition about safe driving, most sign, 2 weeks later asked if they could put drive safely sign in lawn, almost 60% said yes.

  

3. Lowballing: give low price to make customer agree, then increase it and they will still comply
    

- already gone through the trouble, where to draw the line
    

4. Strategic Anticonformity: reverse psychology
    

  

Obedience: conformity in response to commands of authority figure

Orne (1962): tried to develop a task subjects would refuse to do (for long), stack of paper with rows and rows of numbers, told to add up row and put sum at the end, told to add adjacent numbers and then destroy paper, gave subjects 2000 sheets and left, experimenter gave up after 5.5 hours where people were still going 

  

Milgram Experiment Giving Shocks: one of most famous social psychology experiments

- conducted after WW2, questions about how could people commit such atrocious acts, are we evil? Milgram considered if context allowed acts to occur and asked if other people would do the same thing in the same situation.
    
- real p recruited for study on human memory/strategies to help them learn better, confederate appeared as 2nd ‘participant’ in study, real p ‘randomly assigned’ to be the teacher and confederate is assigned as learner, told studying if applying shocks will influence learning, p quizzing learner on series of word pairs, then read only first word and 4 choices, learner presses switches to indicate choice of answer, told to shock learner every time he gets answer wrong, given a test shock to understand shocks 45V, shock level increases by 15v with each wrong answer (15 to 450V), at first it's fine, learner gets few right and few wrong, starts to moan in pain, learner complains of heart trouble, demands to be released, experimenter says it’s fine and wont hurt them, eventually stops responding (in another room so could be unconscious)
    
- 40 males from 20-50, range in occupation/education level (not finished elementary to doctorate/professional degrees, obtained from newspaper ad)
    

Key Points:

- 80% continued after learner screams “my heart is bothering me, I won’t be in the experiment anymore”
    
- 63.5% of subjects delivered maximum shocks
    
- obedience depends on psychological forces of commander and victim (differed in different versions of experiment)
    
- participants were debriefed on study truth, procedure and that it wasn’t real
    

Why did it happen?

- psychiatrists estimate that <1% of people would use maximum shocks
    
- Not blind, heartless obedience. many ps showing discomfort, wanting to stop but in strong and overwhelming environment
    
- Sadistic dark side or human nature? ps demeanor is tortured
    
- Power of situation? gradual shock increase (where do you draw line), confusing situation and experimenter behaviour (pushing to do next shock), seemingly appropriate transfer of responsibility (experimenter saying I accept responsibility)
    

Versions:

Tuning in Victim

- standard: in different rooms, hear person in pain in another room (62% all the way)
    
- 1.5 feet close to them/same room (less)
    
- physically holding hand down on shock plate (even less)
    

Tuning out Experimenter

- standard
    
- telephone: experimenter on phone not in-person (about 18%)
    
- disagreement between experimenters: (0%)
    
- given opportunity to choose shock (very few)
    

Reflections on Disobedience:

- standard paradigm: what about the ⅓ that disobeyed?
    

Packer’s (2008) re-analysis:

- two types of comments = expressions of pain and requests for release
    
- key turning point: 150V, not 1st expression of pain but 1st time he requests to be released (if going to disengage this is where they would, otherwise point of no return)
    

  

Self-Justification: justifying actions done for obedience to reduce dissonance, makes drawing line difficult

  

Week 10: Aggression

  

What is Aggression?

Aggression: intentional behaviour intended to cause physical or emotion pain

1. Hostile Aggression: inflicting mental or psychological pain on  other is main goal
    
2. Instrumental Aggression: inflicting pain on other is means to an end (goal is not to inflict pain)
    

- can look the same but goal differentiates
    

  

Why Do People Behave Aggressively?

Situational Causes of (Hostile) Aggression:

  

Bowling for Columbine:

Hostile Behaviour: shooting others

Causes of Hostile Aggression: modeling (copying violent media, family violence, social exclusion, poverty, guns

  

1. Social Learning:
    

- children copy adult behaviour, always important and influential
    
- when kids see parents/others acting aggressively they are more likely to be aggressive and can be rewarded for this (sports playing, cheering when a fight, office cut throat behaviour leads to a promotion or raise)
    

Social Learning Theory: we learn social behaviour by observing others (models) and imitating them

Observational Learning: learning by observing others

Classic Bobo Doll Experiment (Bandura): kids invited into lab, assigned to control group (saw adult show no aggression to doll) or experimental group (saw adult kick, throw, beat doll), then given a chance to play with bobo doll, kids who saw nonaggressive did not beat doll, kids who saw aggressive adult modeled behaviour and made new aggressive behaviours 

- same is true in real world, 8 days after Columbine shooting a student in Alberta committed a copycat killing (news coverage can seem like reward and encourage copying behaviour)
    

2. Media: videogames, movies, music
    

Diverse Evidence:

1. Anecdotal Evidence: violent media leads to aggressive
    
2. Experimental Evidence: 
    

Anderson and Dill 2000, Study 1: correlation between amount of time playing violent video games and aggressive delinquent behaviour (0.46), could be that more aggressive people seek out violent video games or unknown third variables (absentee parents without supervision home alone)

Anderson and Dill 2000, Study 2: college students randomly assigned to play video game 3x a week, Wolfenstein 3D: violent video game, Myst: equally engaging nonviolent game

- then after a week came back into lab and play competitive game with another student, could act aggressively to other p, DV was level/duration of white noise blast at opponent, able to control how loud/how long noise administered was
    
- students who played the violent video game delivered longer, more powerful white noise blasts to opponents
    

Meta-Analysis by Anderson and Bushman (2001): looking at 54 studies with 4,200 participants found that violent video game use associated with increased aggression, decreased helping, increased aggressive thoughts, increased anger/arousal, same effect for males and females, children and adults

3. Income Inequality:
    

- poverty: act aggressively to gain access to resources or goods
    
- Income Inequality: not about how much you have, but how much you have relative to others that determines aggression
    
- in neighbourhoods with more income inequality there are more violent acts like homicides, also on level of cities and countries (higher aggression in US than Canada because more income inequality)
    
- evolutionary account: intense competition for resources
    

4. Social Exclusion:
    

- humans are social creatures, need social belonging and acceptance, it hurts a lot when we are excluded
    
- direction of causality? lashing out because excluded or excluded because aggressive?
    

Twenge 2001 Social Exclusion and Aggression: ps come into lab and chat with 4-5 people, each p asked to write 2 people they want to work with, given popular condition where told that everybody wanted to work with them or unpopular where told nobody wanted to work with them, then to measure aggression ps had opportunity to deliver white noise to stranger, excluded ps gave louder and longer white noise bursts to a stranger (not someone who excluded them!)

5. Aggressive Objects:
    

Berkowitz and LePage 1967 Guns and Aggression: ps brought into lab,

given task and told doing it wrong so they were frustrated, then given chance to act aggressively to others (deliver electric shocks to another p), while moving to another room passed a gun or a badminton racket, people who saw gun, ps who were angry and saw gun gave much longer shocks when gun was present in room than if badminton racket (had to be angry/frustrated to change behaviour)

6. Frustration: 
    

Frustration-Aggression Theory: 

1. goal blockage: leads to frustration, especially when very close to achieving goal (if not close unlikely to exert aggression because low frustration, outcome not that changed)
    

Harris (1974): researcher sent confederate to cut into lines at crowded restaurants, movies, theme parks, always cut in after the second person or twelfth person, people at the front were much more likely to become frustrated and act aggressively because close to goal

2. perceived injustice: if everyone but me gets something this injustice leads to frustration so aggressive behaviour is more likely
    

Fairness Study with Capuchin Monkeys: put two capuchin monkeys side-by-side, they complete simple task (give rock to researcher), if they both get cucumber (don’t love) they will still do task 25 times in a row, if you give one grapes and other cucumber the cucumber monkey will be frustrated and act aggressively

- helps explain effects of exclusion (denied access to groups others are part of) and inequality (denied access to resources others have)
    

7. Heat and Colour:
    

Heat:

Anderson 1989: number of hot days (over 32 degrees C) predict aggressive crime increase like murder

Heat Study: ps asked to complete study in hot (32 degree) or cold (21 degrees) room, then given chance to act aggressively adn hot room acted more aggressively

- ML baseball pitchers hit batters more on hot days
    

Colour:

Black: evil and dealth in most cultures, leads to aggression

Jerseys Correlation: NHL and NFL teams with 50%+ black jerseys had highest penalty record

Jersey Causation: given new black jerseys and aggression increased, ps randomly given black jerseys or white jerseys, asked if wanted to compete with aggressive or more friendly games, black jerseys wanted more aggressive games (didn’t actually play them)

  

Individual Differences:

Gender: 

- 99% of rapists, 88% of murderers, 87% of aggravated assaulters are men (based on arrest records)
    
- aggressive behaviour isn’t only physical violence, can take other forms, men and women enact aggression in different ways
    
- movies suggest gender differences in aggression, are they true?
    

Bjorkqvist, Lagerspetz, Kaukinen (1992): direct aggression: phsyical/insulting, indirect aggression: gossiping/shunning, gender differences emerge during teenage years, in childhood children are engaging in roughly same levels of aggression, as move into teenage years females do more indirect aggression

  

Evolutionary:

Men: more aggressive to defend group, two main reasons:

1. establishing dominance, securing high status
    
2. sexual jealousy, ensuring paternity
    

Women: protecting offspring

- innate aggression impulse can be overridden by experience
    

Culture: 

- collectivist cultures = less aggression
    
- honour cultures = more aggression
    

Gender:

Men: physical aggression, proving masculinity, part of male identity/role

Testosterone: male sex hormone increasing aggression (produced in aggression)

Women: social/convert aggression

  

Chemical/Physiological Influences:

1. Alcohol: increases aggression by decreasing inhibitions
    
2. Pain/Discomfort: lower threshold for aggression (including heat)
    
3. Serotonin (?): neurotransmitter controlling mood, attention, sleep and pain, may have link to aggression but inconclusive so far
    

  

Social/Situational Causes:

1. Frustration-Aggression Theory: frustration increases aggressive response
    

Frustration: attempt to achieve goal is thwarted (closer goal = more frustration)

- more likely to respond aggressively to inconvenience when frustrated
    
- more aggressive response when safe/anonymous (no repercussions)
    

2. Relative-Deprivation: perception of having less than one deserves/expects
    
3. Provocation: if provoked with perceived aggressive intent, respond with aggression
    
4. Social Exclusion: causes aggression towards others
    
5. Weapons Effect: increase in aggression caused by presence of objects linked to aggression
    

  

Media Violence Impact:

1. TV/Movies: watching violence increases aggression (especially if have aggressive tendencies)
    

- more violence watched as child/teen = more exhibited as adult, exaggerated perception of danger/risk
    

2. Video Games:
    

- creates unconscious self-appraisal with criminal descriptors
    
- increases stress while playing
    
- decreases empathy and prosocial behaviour
    

3. Pornography: exposure increases sexism and sexual violence (verbal and physical)
    

- causes dehumanization and numbing effect (less upset by violence, less empathetic)
    

  

How Can Aggressive Behaviour Be Reduced?

Decreasing Aggression:

1. Punishment: mild punishment more effective than severe punishment, effective if
    

1. Prompt (immediate)
    
2. Certain (unavoidable)
    

(this is not realistic in real life or justice system)

2. Catharsis: (not a good strategy) ‘getting out’ anger/aggression (real or vicarious) decreases aggression 
    

- concept from Freudr idea of aggressive impulses hydraulic system, releasing built up aggressive energy
    

Bushman (1999) Punching Bag Study: ps invited into lab, provided with article arguing for effecticeness/ineffectiveness of catharsis through punching inanimate object, then insulted by confederate, then opportunity to hit punching bag, present or absent, DV: white noise blasts administered to someone else. Ps that read article praising benefits of hitting inanimate objects and engaged in catharsis were the most aggressive, regardless of target (aggressive at everyone)

Violent Sports: football players more aggressive late into season (contrary to idea of catharsis)

- actually increases aggression and anger
    
- aggressing decreases inhibitions for subsequent aggression, increases negative view of target (to decrease dissonance), promoting aggression
    

3. Non-aggressive role models: seeing models acting in non-aggressive ways when provoked leads to reacting in less aggressive ways
    
4. Defuse frustration and anger early on through apology: quickly offering apology for misdeeds avoids frustration turning to anger
    
5. Empathy: putting yourself in someone else’s shows decreases aggression
    

Baron (1976): car at light, light turns green, did not move for 10 seconds, in one condition someone walks between 1st and 2nd car, in empathy condition someone on crutches hobbles between them, people were less likely to honk when car didn’t move and they had seen someone on crutches beforehand

6. Communication:
    

- calm, clear statement of events and effects on feelings
    
- apology reduces aggressive response
    
- empathy reduces desire for revenge
    

  
  

Week 11: Prejudice

  

Lecture Week 11

  

Perceiver’s Perspective

Prejudice: hostile and negative attitude of someone based on group membership 

1. Affective (Emotional) Component: feelings (prejudice)
    

Prejudice: can be positive or negative feeling toward someone based on membership in group (most commonly positive)

2. Cognitive Component: set of cognitions (stereotypes)
    

Stereotypes: generalization across group of people where identical characteristics are assigned to all members of group regardless of actual variation of members most likely for social groups

- simplifies complex works (schemas applied to groups), resistant to change in face of new information, most gossipable/different traits stereotyped
    

3. Behavioural Component: set of resulting behaviours (discrimination)
    

Discrimination: unjustified negative or harmful action directed toward member of group based solely on group membership

- not always obvious or overt
    

Gender Bias in Sciences (Moss-Racusin 2012): 127 faculty at research institutions sent job application for lab manager, identical application but gender male or female, then asked to rate applicants on different measures of competence, hireability, mentoring, females are rated lower in all three, female applicants offered lower starting salary (30,238 v. 26,507), even by female faculty, not overt and obvious, rated female applicants as more likeable just didn’t translate to working competencies (not all dimensions)

  

Causes of Prejudice:

  

1. Social Categorization/Cognition: automatic creation of groups (underlies all cognitive function), represents basic way our brain simplifies the world, byproduct of using schemas
    

Social Identity Theory: tendency to understand world by grouping objects based on similarity, see world in terms of groups, some we are a part of and some we are not (us v. them), prefer groups we are in

In-Group Bias: favour members of our group (even when same behaviours), effects any arbitrary group, we like people who like what we like

Klee v. Kandinsky Artwork Study: ps look at two pieces of art, decide which they preferred, told they were in klee or kandinsky group, then put them with other people who liked same paintings and had to make series of decisions with group members (rate liking and divide resources), liked their group better than outgroup, rated ingroup members as having more pleasant personalities, did better work, when asked to distributing fixed resource (money) they would rather give group leg up, even at cost to themselves ($2 us 1$ them rather than $3 us $4 them), group members were strangers, make groups quickly and prefer groups

- very intuitive, basic instinct to feel group membership with others
    

Hamlin (2013): this preference emerges early, 9-14 month olds like people who

treat similar others well and dissimilar others poorly

1. Social Identity Benefits: form identity from group, so must justify group as superior (especially if threatened), strong group identity = favour group more
    
2. Self Esteem Benefits: putting down other groups boosts own group and self esteem, more supportive of group when doing well (bandwagon effect), more likely to discriminate against outgroup when group feels threatened
    

Outgroup Homogenity: perception that outgroup members are all the same

Princeton and Ruteers (rival schools) Study: ps (students from both schools)

watched video of male p pick audio clip that he liked, led to believe man was from

either of the schools, predict what others from the same school would like, when

thought man in video was in ingroup, his choice was not indicative of what other

students like, if student went to another school, their choice reflected what

everyone in outgroup liked

  

Hidden Prejudices:

- not all stereotypes people report, they have a desire to look good or have unknown associations
    

Modern Racism: outwardly unprejudiced actions with inward prejudiced attitudes

Implicit Association Test (IAT): designed to capture index of people’s implicit attitudes about various groups

- seated at computer with two words on left and two words on right meant to represent different categories, then shown image or word in middle of screen and asked to categorize it into one of the groups. testing time to respond to measure implicit bias through strength of associations
    
- most people are faster when Black is paired with bad than when Black is paired with good (implicit prejudice = speed(blackbad) - speed (blackgood)
    

Effects of IAT (subtle discrimination)

1. Social: implicit prejudice leads to unfriendly verbal behaviours toward an African American (Dovidio 1998)
    
2. Political: implicit prejudice means less likely to vote for Obama (Greenwald 2009)
    

  

Reducing Prejudice: 

1. Motivations: personal motivation to control prejudice (higher motivation leads to less explicit and implicit prejudice)
    
2. Maintain positive self views: activate stereotypes when they help boost self esteem
    

- different responses when positive or negative feedback from stigmatized group
    

Sinclair and Kunda (1999): ask ps to imagine they received very positive or negative feedback from white of black manager, measured racial attitudes, reflected that ps has low levels of black negativity, when positive feedback given from black manager the negative stereotype is pushed away to accept praise, when negative feedback higher black negative stereotype to disregard

Sinclair and Kunda (2000): ps rate profs from last term on scale from 0 (poor) to 100 (excellent) and report grades, when high grades rate both highly, when do poorly females are rated much more poorly

1. Experiencing discrimination yourself/ Teaching people not to hate (Jane Elliot segregating children based on eye colour and experience discrimination to recognize how painful discrimination can be), the experience of discrimination can make people less discriminatory
    
2. Changing Stereotypes: exposure countering stereotypes changes activation
    
3. Peers can teach tolerance, low and high prejudice student paired for discrimination discussion, low prejudice children teach others not to hate
    
4. Contact Hypothesis: brings majority and minority groups together to reduce prejudice, mostly theoretical, need preconditions:
    

Critical Conditions for Contact:

1. mutual independence
    
2. common goal
    
3. equal status
    
4. friendly, informal setting
    
5. multiple members of out-group present (not just thinking of one as special exception)
    
6. social norms support equality
    

Allport Conditions:

1. both groups are equal status
    
2. both groups share common goal
    
3. contact involves intergroup cooperation
    
4. contact is supported by law and social norms
    

5. Jigsaw Classroom: small mixed groups with shared responsibility and must share information to work on shared task (each have own critical part of task, group success relies on everyone), builds trust and cooperation, decreases prejudice
    
6. Extended Contact Hypothesis: knowing someone in your ingroup is close to someone in out-group can reduce outgroup prejudice (take one member from each group to work together, go back to groups and share positive experience, proliferate greater understanding) Dr. Steve Wright class called extended relations
    
7. Harness larger sense of shared identity  (super ordinate groups), recategorize us and them in terms of greater groups we share
    

  

2. Stereotypes: only harmful if active
    

Activating Factors:

1. race/demographic
    
2. environment/contect
    
3. speed of response (automatic v. controlled thinking)
    
4. motivation to control stereotypes/prejudice
    
5. potential self-esteem boost 
    

Meta-Stereotyping: how one believes outgroup sees them

- more prejudiced if believe outgroup is prejudiced towards
    

3. Affect and Mood: emotions elicited by group are strongest predictor of prejudice
    
4. Ultimate Attribution Error: dispositional attributions made on group level
    
5. Realistic Conflict Theory: limited resources produce conflict, prejudice and discrimination
    

Reducing: Mutual Interdependence: relying on each other to achieve common goal

6. Normative Rules: fit in with majority views
    

Injustification: believing status quo is the way things should be/morally right (justifying system to reduce dissonance, especially if system is threatened)

  

Target’s Perspective

Members of stigmatized groups are treated differently

- Barden (1989): babies with craniofacial deformity receive less nurturing treatment from moms, moms report relationships are positive but videotaped interactions show less smiles in 10 second intervals than control group
    

- even members of stigmatized groups themselves may absorb prejudice and think of themselves as less than
    

Clark and Clark (1947): black kids (3-7) offered identical black or white dolls, asked which they preferred and wanted to play with, most children reject black doll, significant even at age 3, 59% agree that black doll looks bad, majority say white doll is nice colour and looks nicer

- these were cited by US Supreme Count in Brown v. Board of Education (1954) in striking down racial segregation
    
- now white doll preference is greatly reduced
    
- controversial, stigmatized group members do not report reduced self-esteem (theoretically they should if internalizing prejudice), in group support to maintain high self esteem
    

  

Effects of Prejudice:

1. Self-Fulfilling Prophecy: acting with prejudice fulfills and confirms them
    
2. Social Identity Threat: apprehension at being evaluated as group member (burden impairs performance and fulfills stereotypes)
    
3. Stereotype Threat: heightened sense of anxiety about not confirming a negative stereotype about one’s group that gets in the way of successful performance
    

- is a situational explanation for group differences in performance, does not suggest that people in stigmatized groups are not good at tasks
    
- do not need to believe negative stereotype for stereotype threat to occur
    
- worry of confirming stereotype = distraction = poor performance
    

Steele and Aronson (1995): recruited black and white American students to take difficult test of verbal ability (stereotypes about black people not as verbally able), manipulation was asking v. not asking to list race on preliminary demographics survey (bringing race to mind), stereotype threat shows by race reminder diminishing black student performance, no race prime black students outperform white students, when race prime black students underperform compared to white students

- 150+ studies since original in 1995
    

Examples:

- women: worse math performance, driving ability
    
- white man: worse performance of tests of ‘natural athletic ability’
    

Reducing (Johns, Schmader, Martens (2005): men and women take difficult math

test (GRE), 3 conditions: control (problem-solving exercise for study of general

aspects of cognitive processes), stereotype threat (study of gender differences in

math performance), threat + teaching (told anxiety felt at taking exam could be

because of results of negative stereotypes that do not reflect actual ability)

- control did about equal, threat women did worse threat + teaching did about equal
    

I am more than one thing (Shih 1999): female prime condition: list gender and

answer questions relevant to gender identity, ethnicity prime condition: list

ethnicity and answer questions relevant to ethnic identity, control: irrelevant

questions, DV: math test result

- female prime = worse performance, ethnicity prime = improved performance, students not aware of performance effects (no difference in how well students thought they did)
    

  

Reducing Stereotypes and Prejudice

- Common identity:
    

Common identity study: target: homosexual males, cover story: imagine you are account manager for study on hiring decisions, choosing 2 out of 3 candidates to interview for job (1 highly qualified, 2 moderately qualified and gay, 3 weak), manipulation is using recategorization language adopting broader identity in personal statements (we, together, teamwork) or not recategorization (I, my)

- likelihood of target being chosen for interview control: 50%, common identity: 79%, common identity strategy = more likely to get an interview/less discrimination
    

  

Textbook Chapter 12: Prejudice

Gender:

Women:

1. Hostile Sexism: negative stereotypes of women
    
2. Benevolent Sexism: positive stereotypes of women
    

Men: aggressive, dominating, cold

  

Individual Differences:

1. Right-Wing Authoritarianism: high levels of
    

1. Authoritarian Submission (to authority figures)
    
2. Authoritarian Aggression (to groups authorities target)
    
3. Conventionalism (conform to rules)
    

3. Religious Fundamentalism: belief in absolute/literal truth of religious beliefs
    
4. Social Dominance Orientation: belief that some groups should dominate others
    

  

Week 12: Attraction

  

Studying Love:

1. Importance: 
    

1. fundamental and universal aspect/need of human nature
    
2. people have a very strong need to belong (man is a social animal, Aristotle)
    

3. Challenge: few studies because random assignment is unethical (hallmark of experimental method)
    

  

(The Beginning) Factors Leading to Attraction (5 key ingredients)

Attraction: innate need for self-expansion, to blend with others to deepen life experience

1. Propinquity Effect (Proximity): the more likely we see and interact with people the more likely they are to become our friends/lovers 
    

- both large and small scales (geographically and granular)
    

Study of Proximity and Friendship: asked large group of students living in dorms in US college to list closest friends and where they live, each dorm had 10ish apartments, dorms were filled at random so did not know people initially, 65% best friend in same building, 41% best friend was next door, 22% two doors apart, 10% opposite ends of the hall

Functional Distance: architectural paths/features that allows for more interaction

and friendship formation (people who live near gathering spaces have more

friends)

- frequency/proximity produces attraction
    
- if obnoxious frequency produces repulsion
    

- considers physical and functional (amount of running into them) distance
    
- present online and in-person
    

Mere Exposure Effect: the more we are exposed to any stimulus the more we like

it (unless extremely aversive, then like it less) 

Moreland & Beach, 1992: strategically sent female confederate to classes either 0,

5, 10 or 15 times over the term, did not talk to anybody, just went to front row

where people could see, at end of term people asked to rate them on

dimensions/attraction/liking, the more classes she attended the more they rated

her as attractive

2. Similarity: attraction to people like us
    

Mimicry: in the moment demonstrating similar body posture to others to increase attraction

Roy and Christenfeld, 2004: people choose purebred dogs who look like themselves, showed people images of them and people matched them up by appearance

- most attraction when similar values, leisure activities, attachment/communication style
    
- provides social validation, we assume they will like us
    
- attraction also leads to perception of similarity (perceived similarity predicts attraction better than actual similarity)
    

Complementarity: attraction to people opposite to us

3. Reciprocal Liking: we like people that like us, can overpower similarity
    

- only works if you like yourself
    
- we appreciate people who like us
    

4. Physical Attractiveness: strongest predictor of initial attraction
    

Hatfield Study: 752 new students randomly paired for orientation dance, in advance had colleagues answer questions to pair up the students, after dance asked to rate date after dance, greatest predictor of liking one’s date is physical attractiveness

Attractiveness: generally concepts of beauty are shared

1. Woman: high eyebrows, small nose, small chin, large eyes, prominent cheekbones, large pupils, large smile
    
2. Woman: big eyes show baby like qualities, prompt feelings of nurturance, youth, fertile, innocence
    
3. Men: large eyes, large chin, big smile, prominent cheek bones, signs of sexual maturity
    

Matching Phenomenon: people tend to pair off with people equal in attractiveness, predicts relationship satisfaction and longevity (differences = jealousy/concern)

- aware of importance but reluctant to admit it
    
- similar across cultures (large eyes, pronounced cheekbones, smiling)
    

What Is Beautiful Is Good Stereotype: we assume beautiful people have 

positive (social) traits, similar across cultures (but traits differ), may be

self-fulfilling prophecy where positive attention leads to better social skills

5. Misattribution of Arousal: people mistakenly infer what is causing them to feel the way they do, thinking arousal from something else is from attraction
    

Capilano Suspension Bridge (Dutton and Aron 1974): female researcher posing as research assistant approaches men on low, sturdy bridge and high swinging suspension bridge asking to help with study she was conducting to fill out survey, when filled out said thank you so much, ripped off corner and gave phone number, more men (5x more) called from suspension bridge than footbridge

- men noticed hearts pounding and misinterpreted that arousal as attraction to woman as reason for excitement not swinging suspension bridge
    

  

Evolutionary Theory of Attraction: love and attraction driven by goal of reproductive fitness (passing on genes), people have evolved to maximize chances of reproductive success, different strategies for men and women

1. Men: little cost, preference is frequent pairing, youth/appearance signals fertility, desire fertility, offer wealth/status
    
2. Women: high cost, prefer quality pairing, wealth signals resources, desire status/wealth, advertise fertility and beauty
    

Study Clark and Hatfield 1989: had attractive college student approach students of opposite sex and say I’ve been noticing you around, I find you very attractive, varied endings (would you go out with me tonight, would you come to my apartment, would you go to bed with me tonight?), go out response 50% even, apartment 70% males, less than 10% females, go to bed no females and 80% males 

  
  

(During) What is Love?

Love: comes in many forms

  

Bershid and Hatfield 2 Distinct Types of Love:

1. Passionate/Romantic: intense longing, physiological arousal 
    

- fulfillment and ecstacy when going well, sadness and despair when not
    

- activation of Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) and Caudate Nucleus circuit (activated when on cocaine)
    
- body treats person we are attracted to as goal we “must” have (like it treats food and oxygen)
    
- more valued in Western cultures where love is personal choice
    

2. Companionate Love: intimacy and affection for another person we care deeply about
    

- (friendship) affection and intimacy with intertwined lives
    

- most important aspect of lay definition of love
    
- more valued in Eastern cultures where not a personal decision/arranged
    

  

3. Compassionate (parenting)
    
4. Attachment (child to parent)
    

- men fall in love faster (romantic), women more practical (companionate)
    

  

Sternberg’s (1986) Triangular Theory of Love:

- love has 3 ingredients, can be combined to form different flavours of love
    

1. Intimacy: knowing a lot about each other and being close/bonded
    
2. Commitment: intention to maintain relationship
    
3. Passion: hot stuff, sexual arousal

Theories of Love:

1. Evolutionary Theory: maximizing reproductive success (fitness) is the game
    

- men looking for attractiveness/fertility
    
- women looking for power and resources (may also be due to media conditioning and less financial power of women)
    

2. Attachment Theory: behaviour, coping strategies and expectations in adult relationships is formed by parent-child relationship as infant
    

- can also have different styles for different people/relationships
    

1. Secure: trust and lack of concern with abandonment, feeling worthy and loved (responsive parent)
    
2. Avoidant: suppression of attachment needs because attempts have been rebuffed (distant parent)
    
3. Anxious/Ambivalent: concern others will not reciprocate intimacy results in anxiety (inconsistent parent)
    

- come off as withdrawn/awkward (so perceived as less attractive)
    
- so anxious they will be rejected that think they are showing clear romantic interest (so subtle others don’t notice)
    
- desperate for a relationship but need constant validation
    

  
  

(The End (or not) What Makes Love Last? (362 relationships)

  

1. Social Exchange Theory: views relationships with economic model of costs and benefits, staying in relationship/feelings about relationship depend on:
    

1. Reward/Cost Ratio: balance of rewards and personal costs (unfavourable means less relationship satisfaction)
    
2. Comparison Level: expectations about reward/cost ratio deserved
    
3. Comparison Level for Alternatives: cost/reward ratios of other possible relationships, whether they could have a better relationship elsewhere
    

  

2. Investment Model of Relationship Commitment (Rusbult, 1980): predictors of relationship success
    

- need to consider level of investment in relationship, investments can include material objects (money, house, possessions) or intangibles (emotions, time), greater investment = less likely to leave
    

1. relationship satisfaction (rewards and costs)
    
2. investment (apartment, kids, many years in relationship)
    
3. quality of alternatives: other people and things available outside relationship
    

  
![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/XVhnHfaY3GalGC4Tll3sTdZHUM8vabIHlvMQGYSbIWyk_EPIkNaF5heqH-edkj7kZza3zZf4e1AYUNDyt3eX3Ni5uWVzveIYJmbvNObeui_jgzuhKOEByJYdYkL4MHrjfcZIHFjxTA4dyB7mckVCIVU)

- relationship success depends on assessment of costs and rewards, kind of relationship deserved and probability of better options
    

Commitment: more commitment means less attracted to alternatives, more forgiving

  

b. Equity Theory: relationships are most satisfying when both parties feel they contribute equally, feeling uneasy when we are over or under benefited (want to be even)

- uncomfortable outcomes when these two relationships mix (ex: paying friends to help)
    

1. Exchange Relationship (casual friend/acquaintance): governed by need for equity, repay immediately, feel exploited when contributions are not returned, keep track of who contributes what, helping other has no effect on mood
    
2. Communal Relationship (close friend/family): governed by care for others’ needs regardless of fairness (expect other to return the favour), don’t feel need to be repaid immediately, don’t feel exploited when contributions are not returned, don’t keep track of who contributes what, helping others makes us happy
    

  

2. Commitment Calibration Hypothesis (Lydon 1999): impact of adversity on relationship depends on commitment/strength of relationship
    

1. high commitment, low adversity = relationship is not challenged, will overcome
    
2. low commitment, high adversity = relationship ends
    
3. commitment = adversity = relationship strengthened
    

  

3. Positive Illusions (Murray and colleagues, 1993): idealizing partner and relationship in order to maintain the relationship
    

- we make up qualities and positive spins on faults
    

Murray, Holmes and Griffin (1996): recruited selection of romantic couples and rate themselves and partner on range of attributes (patient, understanding, witty), looked for understanding of positive illusions (partner rating higher than self), couples with more positive illusions at time 1 have more relationship satisfaction and stability at time 2 in longitudinal studies

- the more we idealize our partners the happier we are and the longer relationships last, partners also begin to live up to positive illusions, over time people see themselves as partners see them
    

  

4. Self-Expansion: keeping things interesting by trying new things together
    

  
  

Digital Connections:

- people report feeling less connected where one person in group is on their phone, presence of phone (not even theirs) lowers feelings of closeness/empathy
    

1. Social Compensation Hypothesis: shy, lonely people lacking social skills are more likely to form online friendships
    
2. Social Enhancement Hypothesis: extroverted people use superior social skills to make friends online
    

- has to move to other mediums to get deeper
    
- online people present only best qualities so difficult to assess attraction
    

  

Ending Close Relationships:

John Gottman: 4 Horsemen of relationship dissolution: certain attitudes predict relationship dissolution, each harmful but particularly destructive in combination, predicted end of over 2000 couples with 94% accuracy

1. Criticism: attack on partner’s character (especially with always/never)
    
2. Defensiveness: not engaging to solve issues, whining, seeing self as victim
    
3. Stonewalling: withdrawing
    
4. Contempt: treating partner poorly through mockery, body language (eye roll) or insults, most problematic
    

Interaction Dynamics Approach (Gottman and Levenson 1999): 1st 10 years of marriage, negative affect (contempt) predicts early demise, after 10 years absence of positive affect (ex: humous) means demise, okay to have negative emotions/interactions but needs 5:1 ratio

  

Long-term relationships (Aron, et al. 2000): 

1. Correlational: doing novel/arousing activities means lower boredom and higher relationship satisfaction
    
2. Experimental: randomly assigned to do novel arousing activity or mundane activity (obstacle course with wrists and ankles velcroed for prizes) v. control with mundane, novel arousing condition reported greater relationship satisfaction
    

- misattribution of arousal, trying new things to keep magic alive
    

  

Increased risk if: (may just be more stress)

- financial difficulties, lower SES, unemployment
    
- young age of marriage, premarital pregnancy
    
- parental divorce
    
- unreligious
    
- alcohol abuse
    
- stepchildren
    

Fatal Attractions: traits that attracted you becomes what repulses you

Friendship End: passive methods

Romantic End: active methods

- degree of distress depends if you are dumper or dumpee
    

  

True love myths:

- out of sight out of mind
    
- perceptions of beauty are shared worldwide
    
- familiarity breeds liking
    
- similarities attract
    

  

Week 13: Prosocial Behaviour (last lecture!!!!!!!)

  

Textbook Chapter 10: Prosocial Behaviour

  

Prosocial Behaviour: actions to benefit others

Altruism: desire to help others despite costs to self

1. Evolutionary Psychology: genes increasing chances of individual survival are passed
    

Kin Selection: behaviour helping genetic relatives is passed

Norm of Reciprocity: expect that helping others will lead to them helping you

- even present in infants, adaptive to learn cultural/societal norms
    

2. Social Exchange Theory: we aim to maximize rewards and minimize costs of interactions
    

- helping is future investment, relieves distress at seeing others suffer, increases social approval and self worth
    
- more helping when costs are low/benefits are high
    

3. Empathy-Altruism Hypothesis: helping purely for others with no personal benefit (altruism) comes from sense of empathy
    

Empathy: taking perspective of other person and experiencing events and emotions how they would

- empathy is mentally demanding and difficult so people often don’t do it
    
- helping others makes reward center go off in brain (same as food and sex)
    

When (what situation) will people help?

Murder of Kitty Genovese: lives in NY, was returning from late night shift to walk back to her apartment in the middle of the night, on her way she was walking and someone stabbed her, she screamed, yelled and fought, escaped but the assailant found her and stabbed her more and she died. This happened over 30 minutes and at least 38 people heard but nobody called the police.

- initial reaction: cold, callous New Yorkers (internal attribution FAE)
    
- lesson of social psychology: power of situation![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/t74hcm7b9MSRUNGR6cxyXhWsyZDBoY4jYkwrxqy-A0emvK7OFICymfg3EyADMreLfyapwq-URkcO-UyTVBNxl1IFQsEcNBCQ12hvTjNs0KiwXit0V52yqt4GZGqodXMnUGmm_3Ho8svEq8id7y9ycgc)
    

  

Bystander Intervention Decision Tree (Darley and Latane 1970): people make several decisions before helping someone in an emergency situation, along the way the person can continue to help or be impeded at each decision point, heavily situational (not all but a lot)

1. Noticing Event: less if rushing or distracted
    

Good Samaritan Study (Darley and Batson 1973): recruited seminary students (training to become priests) and told they were going to go give a sermon about parable of Good Samaritan (someone who’s hurt on the side of the road clearly in need of assistance, members of own tribe ignore, member of other tribe brings them home and assists them), randomly assigned to one of 3 conditions: low rush: ‘it’ll be a few minutes before their ready but you might as well head on over’, medium rush: ‘they’re ready for you so go right over’, high rush: ‘they were expecting you a few minutes ago so you should hurry’ to room to give sermon. On the way researchers staged someone hurt in need of help between buildings, low rush: 60-70% offered help, medium rush: 40% helped, high rush: 10%, hurry leads to less helping, more distracted

2. Interpret Event as Emergency: decide someone needs help, need to interpret event as emergency, confusing when others are around, take cues from them in ambiguity
    

Pluralistic Ignorance: phenomenon where bystanders assume nothing is wrong because everyone else looks unconcerned, can impede helping, need to be able to see others’ responses, people conform to what they wrongly believe is others’ unconcerned reaction

Smoke-Filled Room Study (Latane and Darley 1970): participants recruited for study on ‘problems of urban life’ cover story, randomly assigned to be alone or with other people, while filling out survey researchers pumped smoke in, observed reactions, when alone 75% seek help within 6 minutes, when with 3 others 38% seek help

- if one person leaves 75% 3 people should get help 98% of time, this happened because ps weren’t sure smoke was emergency, looked to others not worried so didn’t panic, everyone does the same = inaction because feeding off each others’ inaction/uncertainty
    

Bystander Effect: more witnesses decreases likelihood of helping (lower % help

response and longer delay) (diffusion of responsibility and pluralistic ignorance are

parts of this)

3. Assuming Responsibility: deciding to help, more people around = less likely to help
    

Diffusion of Responsibility: each bystander’s responsibility to help decreases as witnesses increase (when only one witness feel responsibility to help, group of witnesses mean assume other will do it), when we can’t see others’ responses especially, assume someone else will take care of it

Latane and Darley (1968): ps came into lab, told they were participating in a ‘study on student life’, seated alone in a cubicle, told they would have conversations with other students but over intercom to preserve anonymity, discussing struggles and realities of student life, conversing with 1, 3 or 5 other students, as conversation goes on participant hears specified amount of voices over intercom, one person says they have been struggling with seizures due to epilepsy, person later has seizure over intercom system (voices were actually prerecorded)

- thought alone almost 90% got up quickly to check on peer in other room (to their knowledge thought only one who knew about seizure so had to help), when 2 others 60% helped, when 4 others 30% helped
    

4. Knowing How to Help: lack of knowledge or skill
    
5. Deciding to Implement Help: danger or embarrassment, risks, weight costs
    

  

Situational Determinants:

1. Environment
    

1. Urban-Overload Hypothesis: cities are overwhelming so people keep to themselves to avoid overload (rural help more)
    
2. Living in same place a long time (concerns of reputation, more connection)
    

3. Bystander Effect: more witnesses decreases likelihood of helping
    

1. Noticing Event (less if rushing)
    
2. Interpret Event as Emergency (someone needs help)
    
3. Assuming Responsibility (deciding to help)
    

Diffusion of Responsibility: responsibility decreases as witnesses increase

4. Knowing How to Help
    
5. Deciding to Implement Help
    

  

Who helps whom? (individual differences)

Personal Determinants:

Altruistic Personality: traits of sympathy, empathy and responsibility to help others

  

1. Gender: all cultures have different norms for men and women
    

- for years assumed and understood that men helped more due to studies of heroic helping and studies by men (who saw heroic actions as what prosocial behaviour is), actually depends on type of help
    
- women receive more help, may be due to women socialized to feel comfortable asking for help, especially when dressed femininely in emergency situations (shows vulnerability)
    

1. Men: more likely to help in heroic situations, dangerous, risky, hazardous one-offs
    
2. Women: more likely to help in nurturing ways, consistent nurturance and support (long term commitment)
    

  

2. Socioeconomic Status:
    

1. Low SES: communal self-worth (relationships form self), more prosocial
    
2. High SES: agentic self-worth (individual capacity for self control), less prosocial
    

4. Cultural Differences: favour ingroup over outgroup
    

1. Ingroup Help: due to empathy
    
2. Outgroup Help: due to benefits for self
    

6. Religion: makes strong social bonds/social norms of prosocial behaviour
    

- most to people within same religion
    
- most act more prosocially when primed with morality/religion
    

5. Mood: more likely to help if in good mood
    

1. feeling good leads to doing good (continuous feedback loop)
    
2. feeling sad leads to doing good (to make self feel better)
    

  

Increasing helping

1. Positive Mood
    

Isen and Levin (1972): ‘feel good, do good’ effect: when you are in a good mood you are more likely to engage in helping behaviour.

Experiment 1: 52 males studying at library, research assistant walked around and IV either walk by or give them a bag with cookies (happiness boost), DV was willingness to help with data collection task that was either helpful or distracting to others, people who received cookies were more likely to help on tasks that others found helpful, not those others found distracting

- limitations: copying helpful model? those who received cookies reminded of norm ro help, only assessed agreeing to help, not actually doing the helping
    

Experiment 2: IV was staged so people were using payphone and some were

randomly assigned to find a dime (happiness manipulation) and some did not,

walk away from payphone behind confederate who is carrying papers and drops

them all over floor, DV if helping confederate who drops papers. 84% who found

dime helped, 4% who did not find dime helped, good mood increased helping

behaviour (actually did help, no reciprocity norm)

  

Organ Donor Study (Brethel-Haurwitz 2014): authors find that level of wellbeing in

various parts of US (IV) assessed by one of leading most representative surveys

(Gallup) impacts (DV) donation rates for organs, covariates (m/f ratio, proportion of

population with degree/education, ethnicity, median income, gini, health,

religiosity, individualism/collectivism), wellbeing per state is positively correlated

with organ donors

  

2. Positive models: helpful role model means increased helping
    

Helping on Highway: ps were driving down highway and saw someone in need with car trouble exhibiting clear need for assistance, were randomly assigned to see someone else helping someone struggling or not, people were more likely to help when see others helping (influences normative understanding of helping)

  

3. Education
    

Method (Beauman 1978): ps across several classes were randomly assigned to have lesson on bystander intervention tree or unrelated topic, 2 weeks later on way to separate study they walked by a confederate staged to be lying on the floor in presence of confederates who looked unconcerned, results were students who learned about bystander tree were more likely to help

  

Why help?

Perceptions of Helpers: people like helpers, sensitivity to others’s actions begins early in life, even young kids (6mo-10mo) pay attention more and prefer helpers

Hamlin, Wynn, Bloom 2007: show puppet shows (start with squeak to get attention) with different actors, dog shares the ball to play and tiger runs off with it without returning (hinderer) or shows where dog passes to grey tiger and tiger passes back (helper), watch many to counterbalance side and colour of actors, research assistant unaware of which was kind and mean comes out and shows puppets, using looking time and reaches they can see preference for helpers

- even young pre-verbal infants prefer helpers over hinderers
    

Helping Leading to Happiness: growing body of research suggests that helping others leads to happiness, lots of correlational research linking

Dunn, Aknin, Norton (2008): go out in morning, invite ps to participate in study on spending, given 5$ or 20$, instructed to use for personal use (bill/gift) or use prosocially (gift for someone else or charitable donation), polled on morning happiness before and spent money by 5pm and polled on happiness

Personal: gifts for selves, food, earrings, makeup

Prosocial: gifts for family/friends, food for others, donations

- polled on post-happiness, didn’t matter how much spent, mattered who spent money on that made them happier (others = happier)
    
- questions: restricted to students in NA? detectable in more diverse samples? is it only applicable when you have extra resources?
    

  

Examining Gallup World Poll: 234,000+ ps from 136 countries sampled during 2006-2008 Gallup World Poll, asked if donated to charity in last month (y/n) and about happiness and life satisfaction, relationship was positive in 120/136 countries while controlling for income and additional control variables, significant in all 7 world regions, substantial variability but consistent support (direction of correlation)

  

Goody Bag Study: Canada and South Africa (2013): 207 students (86 UBC, 121 U Cape Town), tried to target ps with financial troubles, asked to report baseline happiness (a bunch of other questions in it), in exchange for doing it got payment plus additional money (2.50$), can buy goody bag valued at 3$ where they can buy chocolates/juices/1 each, can either buy for self or child in hospital, also told didn’t need to buy the goody bag could pick up cash after, reported happiness after, lab delivered to hospital (no contact with recipient), researchers and fellow ps were unaware of spending condition (no social praise/expectation)

- prosocial spending leads to happiness in poor (South Africa) and rich (Canada) nations even when no praise or contact with beneficiary
    
- Strengths: captures immediate emotional reward, controls for social relationship building
    

Fundamental Feature: human adults from rich and poor nations around the world experience happiness from sharing resources with others

  

Toddler Study (2012): 20 toddlers (22-24 months) came into lab with guardian and wither meet pupper (touch, pet, interact), child given 8 treats, observe prosocial act (child watch E’s give treat to puppet), non-costly prosocial act: child gives one of E’s treats to puppet, costly prosocial act: child gives own treat to puppet, recorded kids and coded amount of smiling

- giving led to more smiling for giving found treat and own treat
    
- kids smiled more when giving own treat than receiving treat
    
- giving own treat led to higher happiness than giving found treat
    

  

- emotional rewards of giving are observed (to a smaller degree) among ex-offenders and gang involved youth
    

Why: emotional rewards of generous spending have been replicated among young children under 2 years, rich and poor countries, among ex-offenders and gang involved youth, in large pre-registered studies, may be a human universal

  

Practical Help:

1. Getting Help: 
    

1. draw attention/get notices
    
2. identify need for help
    
3. identify specific helper
    

3. Giving Help: recognize and overcome obstacles to helping
    

  

Increasing Helping:

1. awareness of bystander effect and diffusion of responsibility
    
2. prosocial media (video game and music)
    
3. rewarding prosocial behaviour (with personal values)
    
4. modeling prosocial behavioiur
    

  

Course Themes:

1. Power of the situation: situation you find yourself in can have a large and often overlooked impact on behaviour 
    
2. Importance of subjective construal: how we interpret event can matter more than actual event itself (unaware of reality)
    

  

Awareness = Increased Control: recognizing power of social context gives us more control over our lives, being aware of social context pressures can help us to be mindful of which contexts we select

  

5. Your impressions and treatment of others may be influenced by biases you don’t even know you hold

1. implicit prejudice
    
2. cultural psychology
    
3. can have detrimental consequences: self-fulfilling prophecy
    

4. Choose environments that help you be your best self

1. power of the situation
    
2. social norms
    
3. priming (seek great models)
    
4. supportive partners (live up to their idealized version of you)
    

3. Stop and smell the roses

1. good samaritan study
    
2. costs of cognitive business
    

2. Scientific insight into human behaviour, ideas that seem intuitive can be wrong and ideas that sound false may be right

1. ex: catharsis reducing aggression (false)
    
2. seek out novel, testable solutions
    
3. be open (but think critically) about new evidence
    

1. Tolerance: people who do bad things are not necessarily bad people

1. milgram experiment
    
2. the fundamental attribution error
    
3. greater compassion for others and ourselves
