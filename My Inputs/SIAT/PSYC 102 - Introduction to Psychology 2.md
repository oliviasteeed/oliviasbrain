Chapter 1 


Outcomes:

-define psychology

-describe connections psychology has with other disciplines

-describe goals of psychology as a science and characteristics of that science

-describe 7 unifying themes that connect psychology 

-briefly describe major milestones in psychology history

  

Themes:

Psychology:

-empirical 

(knowledge acquired through observation, collect original data to test hypothesis based on existing theories, conclusions based on direct observations)

-theoretically diverse 

(area is huge, no single theory can explain everything, need many points of view for the many different issues)

-evolves in sociohistorical context 

(still evolving, influenced by/ influences the world)

What we study in psychology:

-multifaceted causation 

(behaviour is determined by multiple causes, levels of analysis, behaviour is complex so causes are complex)

-behaviour is shaped by environment and cultural heritage 

(behaviour is taught and inherited)

-heredity and environment jointly influence behaviour 

(nature and nurture)

-our experience of the world is highly subjective 

(see what you expect/ want to see)

  
  

Psychology: science that studies behavior and the physiological and cognitive processes that underlie it, and the profession that applies the accumulated knowledge of this science to practical problems

-comes from Greek words psyche (soul) and logos (mind)

-hub science (connects to many disciplines like medical, law, education, industry)

-goals of psychology:

1. describe precisely how people behave
    
2. understand and explain the cause of behaviour
    
3. predict given circumstances how people will behave
    
4. influence behaviour through knowledge and control of causes
    
5. apply the knowledge to improve the human condition
    

  

Research Areas = 

1. Developmental psychology (human development)
    
2. Social psychology (how people interact/ interpersonal relationships)
    
3. Experimental psychology (sensation, perception, motivation, emotion)
    
4. Behavioural neuroscience/ biological psychology (genetics/ physiological processes effect on behaviour)
    
5. Cognitive psychology (high mental processes like memory and reasoning)
    
6. Personality psychology (what shapes personality)
    
7. Psychometrics (measuring traits with standardized tests)
    
8. Educational psychology (how people learn)
    
9. Health psychology (connections between physical health and mental processes)
    

  

Professional Specialties = 

Clinical = evaluation, diagnosis and treatment of psychological disturbances

Counselling = everyday problems like marriage, career and family

Educational and school = curriculum development

Industrial and organizational = ensuring workplaces are enforcing wellbeing

-today over ⅓ work in independent practice, then academia, then hospital/ healthcare and school/ education

  

Psychology as Science = need empiricism and testable hypothesis (based on some theory), make implicit theory explicit through experiment

  

Definitions:

  

Consciousness = awareness of immediate experience

  

Introspection = careful, systematic self-observation of conscious experience

  

Dualism = mind and body are separate

  

Monism = there is only the body, mind is fiction (science)

  

Behaviour = overt response and activity of organisms

  

Unconscious = contains thoughts, memories, desired below the surface that influence behaviour

  

Cognition = mental processes of acquiring knowledge

  

Psychiatry = branch of medicine concerned with diagnosis and medical treatment of psychological problems and disorders 

  

Theory = system of related ideas that explain a set of observations

  

Sociohistorical = social and historical

  

Culture = customs, beliefs, norms, values, institutions of community that are transmitted socially across generations

  

Critical Thinking = use of cognitive skills/ strategies that increase probability of a desired outcome (knowledge + attitude = critical thinker)

-considering relative strength of argument instead of right/ wrong

-thinking/ transcontextual skills

  

Social Constructivism = creating our own reality

  

Psychology development/history:

-developed from searching for better understanding of ourselves

16th century:

-“psychology” word put together, used to distinguish soul/mind from physical body

18th century:

-“psychology” starts being used by scholars

Influenced by Philosophy and Physiology:

-Ancient Greek Philosophers debate issues of mind/body separation and whether knowledge is innate (nativism) or gained through experience (empiricism)

-Physicians showed how learning the workings of body and brain could be gained through systematic, empirical methods

  

Wilhemn Wundt = founder of psychology

-changed psychology from extension of philosophy and physiology to its own discipline 

-established the first formal laboratory for psychology at the University of Leipzig (psychology’s date of birth is thus known as 1879 when it opened)

-established first journal devoted to publishing psychology research

-trained in physiology, he claimed psychology should be a science modeled after physics or chemistry but studying consciousness. 

-Wundt trained scientists from all over the world, spread psychology

-psychology was born in Germany but grew up in North America

  

-Psychology becomes scientific study of conscious experience

  

Structuralism = psychology should analyze consciousness into its basic elements, investigating how these elements are related

Edward Titchener = leader of structuralism, english who emigrated to USA, trained under Wundt

Wundt = also concerned with consciousness 

-most work centered around perception, sensation, vision, hearing, touch

-studied through introspection (participants trained, then exposed to stimuli and asked to describe quality, intensity and clarity of experience)

  

Functionalism = psychology should investigate the function and purpose of consciousness

William James = influenced functionalism, American scholar

-structuralists are missing the point of stream of consciousness by dividing it up into static elements

-seeked to understand stream of consciousness

-interested in adaptive behaviour to real-world demands and mental testing, patterns of child development, effectiveness of educational practices, behavioural differences between sexes

Dewey = how mind functions in adaptive ways to solve problems/ learn new skills

Gestalt psychologists = can’t abstract human from context, must look at whole picture

Piaget = cognitive stages of development in children

-functionalism “won” but both faded away

  

Theoretical Perspectives:

  

Behaviourism (1913 - present)  = psychology should study only observable behaviour, conducive to scientific thinking

John Watson = founded behaviourism, believed nurture > nature, banished from academia and became a successful advertising executive and first pop psychologist

-abandoning consciousness and focusing only on what we can directly observe

-only verifiable if directly observable

-behaviour + conditioned response = relating behaviour to events (stimuli)

B.F. Skinner = harvard psychologist

-internal/ mental processes can never be studied scientifically, we don’t have to if we examine behavior and stimuli

-all behaviour is governed by external stimuli, free will is an illusion

Fundamental Principle of Behaviour = organisms repeat responses that lead to positive outcomes, do not repeat responses that lead to neutral/ negative outcomes

-repopularized behaviourism

Ivan Pavlov = stimulus-response pairing (dog salivates at bell)

Bandura’s Cognitive Behaviourism = we can learn from consequences of others (environment has impact on behaviour indirectly through thought, memory and anticipation)

  

Psychoanalytic Theory (1900 - present) = personality, mental disorders, motivation are caused by the unconscious, people are not masters of their own minds, based on original sin (no innate good, good learned through society)

Sigmund Freud = created psychoanalytic theory, Austrian physician, controversial and influential for his scandalous theories (behaviour is influenced by how we cope with sexual urges)

-treated mental disorders with psychoanalysis (inspired his theory)

-psychological disturbances are caused by personal conflicts at unconscious level

-humans are in conflict with personality structure like an iceberg.

3 Parts of Personality = 

1. Id = based on pleasure principle (immediate gratification), seeking to satisfy raw biological urges 
    

-primary process thinking = primitive, illogical, irrational, fantasy oriented

  

2. Superego = based on morals, acceptable behaviour learned from society, emerges from ego at 3-5 years old, can be obsessive (perfectionist/ irrational guilt)
    

  

3. Ego = based on reality principle (delay gratification until appropriate), tries to satisfy needs of Id within constraints of Superego, decision making part of personality, wants gratification too but also to avoid consequence
    

-considers social norms, etiquette, customs

-secondary process thinking = rational, realistic, problem solving, long term

  

3 Levels of Awareness = most enduring insight, subconscious influences behaviour

1. Conscious = fully aware right now, currently on your mind 
    
2. Preconscious = just beneath surface, easily retrieved (what you had for lunch yesterday)
    
3. Unconscious =  thoughts, desires, memories well below surface awareness, still influential of feelings/ behaviours (repressed sexual desires, hidden feelings of hostility/ resentment, forgotten trauma)
    

  

Anxiety = result of unconscious battles, ego worrying about

1. Fear of id getting out of control and doing something that leads to severe negative consequences
    
2. Superego getting out of control and making you feel guilty about real or imagined action
    

Defence Mechanisms = people try to rid themselves of anxiety/ guilt with these unconscious reactions, typically work through self-depreciation![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/K94eGttsZHeSvCEX0z7FhJZH-qs1JiKT6F9guFJoVn6jnbFr5v_LWxHbRI2Scmfoyw42iuh3PgGLCYnBrr8w_RQD0MK9DKzPe-eusTsGDR0Ir3T4V9BZfYbenWHPwaP9VQYbwM0VVl7ZEqEOJeGrmA)

-behaviour controlled by subconscious drives (aggression and sex drive because they are most commonly repressed)

1. Repression = keeping distressing thoughts/ feelings buried in unconscious (most common, purposeful forgetting
    
2. Projection = attributing your thoughts/ feelings/ motives to others
    
3. Displacement = diverting emotions (anger) from original source to a substitute target
    
4. Reaction Formation = behaving opposite of your true feelings (exaggeratedly)
    
5. Regression = reversion to immature patterns of behaviour
    
6. Rationalization = creating false, plausible excuses to justify behaviour
    
7. Identification = boosting self-esteem by forming an (imaginary or real) alliance with a person or group
    
8. Sublimation = unconscious unacceptable impulses channeled into something socially acceptable/ admirable
    

  

Contemporaries were uncomfortable with theory because = 

1. People not masters of their own minds
    
2. People not masters of own destinies
    
3. Too much focus on sexual urges (too scandalous)
    

-repopularized studying internal events until Skinner

Carl Jung and Alfred Adler = other prominent contributors, argued that Freud was too concerned with sexuality

  

Humanism (1950s - present) = humans are unique and strive for personal growth and self actualization, basic goodness model (innate good)

Abraham Maslow = made hierarchy of human needs (developmental model), fixate on one level if not met

1. Psychological needs
    
2. Safety/ security needs
    
3. Belonging/ love needs
    
4. Esteem needs
    
5. Cognitive needs
    
6. Aesthetic needs
    
7. Self-actualization needs
    

Carl Rogers = made person-centered therapy that is still influential today

-behaviourism and psychoanalytic theory are dehumanizing (focus on animal/ primitive aspects of humanity)

-optimistic view of humans

-the need to self improve (psychological disturbances are results of these needs not being met)

-humans governed by self concept which animals lack (so testing on animals isn’t relevant to humans)

Carl Rogers and Abraham Maslow = most prominent humanists

Rogers = made person-centered therapy that is still influential today

  

Cognitive (1950s - present) = thoughts and mental processes, humans are rational problem solvers

-to understand behaviour you must understand how people acquire, process and store information

-actually can be studied scientifically (renewed interest in internal but scientific this time)

Jean Piaget, Noam Chomsky, Herbert Simon

  

(These two are kind of one concept)

Behavioural Neuroscience (1950s - present) = physiological, genetic and neural bases of behaviour in animals and humans

-behaviour can be explained by brain structures and biochemical processes that underlie it

-electrical signals can cause pleasure or pain in brain, left/ right brain specialization leads to renewed interest in neurobiological connections to behaviour

-what different parts of the brain/ mental processes do/ control 

James Olds, Roger Sperry, David Hubel, Torsten Wiesel

  

Evolutionary (1980s - present) = all human behaviour is a result of what was genetically/ evolutionarily favourable

-behavioural patterns have evolved to solve adaptive problems

-natural selection favours behaviour that enhances reproductive success (behaviour exists because it benefits the organism)

-how did neural structures arise? How did they increase survival? How did they enhance reproductive success?

-no way of testing this 

David Buss, Martin Daly, Margo Wilson, Leda Cosmides, John Tooby

  

Sociocultural = examining culture’s impact on behaviour

-context (social psychology)

-examining influence and transmission of (macro/ micro) culture

-individualistic v. collective cultures (success of one or many)

  

Levels of Analysis:

1. Biological (neuroscience + evolutionary)
    
2. Psychological (psychodynamic, humanist, cognitive, sociocultural
    
3. Environmental (behavioural + sociocultural)
    

  

Psychology in Canada:

-first experimental laboratory in British empire was at University of Toronto in 1891

-Canadian Psychological Association (1939) = making the rules for psychologists in Canada to follow

  

Psychology as a Profession:

Applied Psychology = in schools, industrial/ organizational, counselling 

Clinical Psychology = branch of psychology that focuses on diagnosis and treatment of psychological problems

-started when psychologists worked at war as clinicians for veterans. They kept doing it after and now about half of PhDs in psychology are clinical psychology

  

Diversifying Psychology:

-psychology developed in Western cultures, they didn’t check if these findings related to non-Western populations (or even women)

-due to 

1. Advances in communication, travel, trade

2. Increased ethnic diversity in western culture

psychologists now realize that culture is determinant of behaviour and are trying to understand how culture is transmitted, changes world view, how people cope with cultural change and how cultural groups are affected by prejudice and racism

  

Positive Psychology = uses theory to understand positive, adaptive, creative, fulfilling aspects of life

-belief that psychology focuses too much on pathology weakness, damage, suffering and neglects to focus on what makes life worth living

-led to exercises designed to promote wellbeing

Areas of Interest:

1. Positive subjective experience (happiness, love, gratitude, contentment, hope)
    
2. Positive individual traits (personal strengths/ virtues like courage perseverance nurturance, tolerance, creativity, integrity, kindness)
    
3. Positive institutions and communities (how societies foster civil discourse, strong families, healthy work environment, strong/ supportive neighbourhood communities)
    

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

Chapter 2 - Experimental Methods

  

Outcomes:

-describe psychology as a science

-ethical considerations in psychology as a science

-research designs to study psychology

-”association” research designs v. “causation” research design

-logic and limitations of correlational research

-describe/ design simple logically correct experimental designs

-explain why statistics are necessary in psychology as science

  

Themes:  
-empiricism

-subjectivity

  

Science:

-verifiable, cumulative, public, parsimonious (explain new things minimum number of constructs)

-not common sense because people in daily life do not employ the same methods as psychologists so they reach different conclusions (people also perceive and remember situations subjectively and jump to incorrect conclusions based on anecdotal evidence)

-approach to knowing about the world

  

Assumptions of science = 

1. Lawful relationship between everything 
    
2. Humans are capable of finding out relationships
    

  

Goals of Science = 

1. Measurement and description (define how each variable is measured)
    
2. Understanding and prediction (understand cause and effect)
    
3. Application and control (apply findings to improve human condition)
    

  

Scientific Process = 

1. Formulate testable hypothesis
    
2. Select research method and design study
    
3. Collect data
    
4. Analyze and interpret data/ draw conclusions
    
5. Report findings
    

  

Benefits to Scientific Approach = 

1. Clarity and Precision
    
2. Intolerance of Error (self correcting)
    

  

Definitions:

  

Journal = periodical that publishes technical/ scholarly material in a narrow area of inquiry (get peer reviewed/ critiqued)

  

Reactivity = participants’ behaviour changes as a result of being observed

  

Random Sampling = choose random people to participate in study (representative selection of society)

  

Random Assignment = all participants have equal chance of being assigned to any group/ condition in study

  

Statistics = using math to organize, summarize, interpret data

  

Correlation = we can measure more than one variable and predict from that one variable the impact on another variable

-cannot show cause and effect (third variable problem)

-positive = as one increases the other does as well

-negative = as one increases other decreases

-zero = no relation

  

Variable = measurable conditions, events, characteristics, behaviours that are controlled or observed in a study

  

Hypothesis = tentative statement about relation between two variables

  

Prediction = provides a direction to relation between variables (hypothesis with intention)

  

Sampling Bias = sample is not representative of larger population (entirely WEIRD western, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic societies)

  

Placebo Effects = participant’s expectations lead them to experience a result from no changed behaviour

  

Ethics:

  

Animals = research with animals in Canada now has stricter rules than human research did 40 years ago

-observe animals for laws of behaviour, do unethical things (couldn’t with humans)

-7-8% of studies have animals (mostly rodents and birds)

-consider anticipated suffering v. importance of research problem v. likelihood of beneficial discovery

  

Humans = 

Guiding Principles from Tri-Council Policy 2010 = 

-respect for persons

-concern for welfare (especially diminished capacity like baby)

-justice (treat everyone justly no matter group)

-balance of benefit to science v. risk to person

-deception (don’t tell hypothesis to participants), controversial because lying causes trust issues and stress

-informed consent

-debrief what they have participated in 

  

CPA code of ethics = 

-respect dignity

-responsible caring

-integrity

-responsibility to society

No torture = waterboarding, sexual humiliation, stress positions, exploitation of phobias

Report results accurately/ fairly

  

Research Methods: approaches to observation, measurement, manipulation and control of variables in empirical studies

-what are variables of interest? What are the operational definitions of that variable?

  

Descriptive Research = accurate and systematic measurement of anything we can observe easily

Approaches = 

1. Naturalistic Observation = observing others in natural state without interfering (less artificial than experiment and only descriptive)
    

flaw = presence of observer can alter behaviour, selection bias, hard to get actual data

2. Case Study = in depth study of one person or group 
    

flaw = highly subjective, not generalizable 

3. Surveys = measurement tools like questionnaire or interview (self reports on many individuals, easy way to get large amount of data quicky/ cheaply on hard to observe behaviour)
    

flaw = wording of questions can influence answers, who signs up is not representative, people less compliant to surveys now

self reporting problems = 

-social desirability bias = giving socially approved answers (happier, healthier, less prejudiced than they actually are)

-response set = respond to questions one way regardless of questions

-halo effect = perception of something spills over into ratings (can’t be objective)

-questionnaire = attitudes

-psychological test = behaviour

-physiological recordings = biological/ neural bases of behaviour

  

Correlational Research = association between variables can predict relationship of variables but cannot establish cause and effect

-pro = can explore questions that are un-experimentable so broadens scope of studyable phenomena

-con = no control so correlated variables are only casually related, no causational relationships established

  

Experimental Research = association between variables establishes cause and effect relationships

Experiment = research method in which investigator manipulates a variable under controlled conditions and observes changes in second variable

-pro = establish cause and effect relationships, variables are controlled

-con = strip away so much context that generalizability may be limited, artificial situations, ethics

-solution is field experiment = sacrifice control for generalizability 

Variables = 

1. Independent Variable = manipulated, vary independently of other factors to see if it has an effect on other variables of interest
    
2. Dependent Variable = hoped it will vary as a result of impact of independent variable
    

Elements of Experiment = 

-participants 

-extraneous variables (uncontrollable but influence dependent variable)

-confounding of variables (2 variables linked, hard to find out how much each individually influenced dependent variable)

-organismic variables (part of organism being examined like handedness or gender)

-2 equivalent groups (randomly assigned)

1. Experimental Group (receives treatment)
    
2. Control Group (does not receive treatment)
    

  

Elements for Inferring Causation = 

(in experiment with between subject design design)

-equivalent groups (randomly assigned)

-control over all factors (operational definitions)

-temporally ordered (first IV then DV)

  

Experiment Design = 

-between subjects/ group design (2 groups compared, random assignment critical)

-within subject design/ repeated measures (participant is their own control, counterbalancing is critical)

-cross-sectional design (similar groups measured like all 6 year olds)

-longitudinal design (same children measured at different ages)

-multiple independent variables together

  

Experimenter Bias = 

-researcher’s expected outcomes influence results obtained

-influence with subtle nonverbals

Double blind procedure = experimenters and participants do not know if they are experiment or control group (avoid experimenter bias)

  

Statistics:

  

1. Descriptive Statistics = organize and summarize data
    

Central Tendency = measures of typical/ average

-median = center of scores

-mean = arithmetic average score (most useful but sensitive to extreme answers)

-mode = most common score

Variability = how much scores vary from each other/ mean

-standard deviation = index of amount of variability in data set (great variability = great standard deviation)

-normal distribution = symmetrical bell-shaped curve that represents how many human characteristics are distributed through population

-percentile score = indicate % of people who score at or below a certain level

Correlation = exists when two variables are related

-correlation coefficient = numerical index of degree of relationship, indicates direction (+/-) and how strongly variables are related (closer to 1 or -1 = strongest)

-coefficient of determination = (correlation coefficient)^2, indicates % variation one variable account for in another variable

-positive correlation = high x = high y

-negative correlation = high x = low y

  

2. Inferential Statistics = interpret and form conclusions from data
    

-statistically significant = less than 5% chance results happened by fluke (small dispersion, large difference between groups)
