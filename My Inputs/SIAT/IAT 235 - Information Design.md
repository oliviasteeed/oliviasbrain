## Notes

Reading Week 1:

The Vignelli Canon (Massimo Vignelli): creativity needs the support of knowledge

Part 1: The Intangibles

1. Semantics: meaning of what is being designed
    

-start with research, forms base for final product

-understanding subject in all aspects

-relate subject information to make sense to receiver

-nothing arbitrary, everything has meaning, purpose, target

2. Syntactics: discipline and control of design language grammar
    

-structure, grid, typeface, text, illustrations, headlines

-consistency comes from appropriate relationships

3. Pragmatics: artifact should be understandable without explanations
    

-final look is byproduct of clarity of design

-clarity of intent = clarity of result

-forceful, elegant, timeless design

4. Discipline: every detail is important because end result is sum of all details
    
5. Appropriateness: specific constraints and context of a problem
    

-directs to correct media, expression, scale, colour, texture

-transcends style

6. Ambiguity: plurality of meanings providing depth
    
7. Design is One: design can be applied to many subjects regardless of style
    

-discipline is not style

8. Visual Power: good design is creative strength, clear concepts, beautiful form
    

-every element expresses content in most forceful way

-visual strength =/ visual impact (vulgarity)

9. Intellectual Elegance: level of intelligence to produce masterpieces 
    

-social responsibility, sense of decency, moral imperative as designer

10. Timelessness: lasting respected design
    

-clear, simple, enduring

-primary shapes and colours

-centered on message, not aesthetics

11. Responsibility: most appropriate/economic solution considering all facets of problem
    

1. to ourselves: integrity of project
    
2. to client: to solve problem in efficient and economic way
    
3. to the public: users of final design
    

-good design stands by itself without excuses, explanations, apologies

12. Equity: respect for history (logos), not new for new’s sake
    

  

Part 2: The Tangibles:

1. Paper Size:
    

1. A series based on golden spiral/German DIN metric standards
    
2. American sizes with ugly, chaotic proportions
    

-size has meaning, choose with aesthetic, functional and ethical considerations

2. Grids, Margins, Columns, Modules: graphic design is organizing information
    

-grid is your most useful tool to organize information and provide consistency/elegance

-smaller modules are less helpful

-columns and rows are needed for order

3. A Company Letterhead: outside margins 10mm, 3 columns (modern), 5 columns (conservative)
    
4. Grids for Books: provide structure and continuity throughout
    

-content determines container

-plan for least photo cropping

-elegant grid aligns with text and image (custom leading to allow this)

-keep space between modules tight (1 line of text)

  

5. Typefaces: The Basic Ones: it’s what you do with type, not the type itself
    

-Garamond, Bodoni, Century Expanded, Helvetica, Optima, Futura, Univers, Caslon, Baskerville

-one of most important elements is size/scale relationship

Typography: discipline to organize information the most objective way possible

-good design isn’t boring or entertaining, it’s invisible

6. Flush Left, Centered, Justified:
    

1. Flush Left: derives from metal composition (faster)
    

-also faster to read left to right

-requires a good rag

2. Centered: lapidary texts, invitations, address on letterhead/business cards
    
3. Justified: textbooks/newspapers
    

7. Type Size Relationship: type size based on column width size
    

-type size: 8 on 9, 9 on 10, 10 on 11 pt for columns up to 70 mm  
-type size: 12 on 13, 14 on 16 for columns up to 140 mm

-type size: 16 on 18, 18 on 20, for larger columns

-no more than 2 type sizes on a page

-body text ½ the size of header/subheader

8. Rulers: bolder rulers between sections, light within sections
    

-text hangs from ruler

9. Contrasting Type Sizes: contrast of large header with small body/subheader and appropriate whitespace
    

-2 type sizes at a time, minimum font styles

10. Scale: most appropriate size of object in natural context
    

-manipulate for a purpose

-mastery requires interpretation of functions

Design: control of every detail

11. Texture: light is master of form and texture, mastering light achieves expression
    

-texture and colour are a mutually supporting dialogue

  

12. Colour: signifier and identifier, conveys specific message
    
13. Layouts: layout reflects interpretation of designer 
    

Icon: image that expresses content in most memorable way

-most helpful device is grid (for order, not excitement)

-most important device is management of whitespace, makes layout sing

14. Sequence: publication is static page experience and cinematic sequence experience
    

-layout that disappears is a good one, simple, not repetitive

15. Binding:
    

1. Cover: laminated with cloth or paper
    
2. Spine: round or square
    
3. Headband: finish between spine and book
    
4. Endpapers: connects book to binding
    
5. Sandwich: binding with separate spine, allows book to be opened flat
    

16. Identity and Diversity: avoid sameness, increase attention while avoiding fragmentation
    

-strong identity with flexibility within

17. White Space: more important than black of type
    

-provides context, separated meanings

18. A Collection of Experiences: economy at essence of good design
    

-most appropriate and lean solution to each problem

-size/scale in relation to each other

19. Conclusion: develop your own vocabulary and language of design
    

  

The Design Process:

UX Design = content design + visual design + interaction design + design research / design process + approach + collaboration + communication (soft skills)

Bill Moggridge: founder of interaction design, designer of first laptop

-“designers start with people, come to solution from POV of people”

  

1. Framing: reinterpret problem in unconventional way
    

Goal: not to solve problem but to see if asking right questions

2. Question Basic Assumptions:
    

1. Linear Thought: working with end in mind in straight line
    
2. Lateral Thought: working to find best solution by exploring many options
    

  

Design Parameters:

1. Approach
    
2. Frame
    
3. Constraints
    

Rocket Ship Analogy: let go of all unnecessary parts

Design: problem finding not problem solving 

Good Design:

1. feasible: 
    
2. viable
    
3. desirable 
    

  

Design Process:

1. frame (what is it? why solve it?)
    
2. options exploration (until lead worth pursuing)
    
3. reflect on results (what did we say? what does it look like? can I improve this?)
    

  

Design Methods:

1. Railway Model (Enzo Mari)
    

-work on simultaneous tracks of function/logistics and poetry/innovation, meet at end

2. Herringbone Model (High Duberly)
    

-try many different directions to find one worth pursuing

  

Problem: unmet need

-need to know symptoms to see cause, then know cause of cause of cause…

Malinowski: 7 human needs, issue if one unmet

1. metabolism
    
2. reproduction
    
3. comfort
    
4. safety
    
5. movement
    
6. growth
    
7. health
    

Scales:

1. well-defined
    
2. ill-defined
    
3. complex/wicked hard
    

Design Language: TYPE + SPACE + IMAGE

Goal of design: formal and compositional unity

Form: what we interface with, uses

Unified Design: ordered, controlled, integrated through composition principles

-the organization is the expression

-minimal parts to convey message

Creating Unity: form using

1. elements of art: line, shape, value, texture, colour
    
2. according to principles of organization: harmony (rhythm/repetition), variety (contrast elaboration)
    
3. employing balance, movement, proportion, dominance, economy and
    
4. SPACE to achieve
    
5. UNITY
    

Design Grammar:

1. Hierarchy: organization based on importance
    

-scale, importance, value/colour, spacing, placement, alignment, type size, leading, indent, line break, type size, type style, rule

2. Clusters: related pieces grouped together 
    

-structure is seen first so effects visual experience at most primitive level

-all relationships are important

-no space without groupings

3. Balance/Asymmetry: balance unifies parts and makes whole > parts
    

-size, texture, value, colour, shape

Rhythm: strong repeating pattern 

-repetition with variation

1. Symmetry: static/inactive
    

1. Reflectional
    
2. Rotational
    
3. Translational
    
4. Radial
    
5. Mosaic balance
    

3. Asymmetry: dynamic/interesting
    

1. Asymmetrical Balance: stability + tension
    

4. Visual Weight: force of attraction
    

-size, colour, value, position, texture, shape, orientation

5. Visual Direction: implied next direction
    

-shape, location, subject matter, movement, structural skeleton

1. Horizontal: calm/stable
    
2. Vertical: formal/alert/balance
    
3. Diagonal: movement/action
    

  

Project One:

-design brief is not set of instructions, make own brief from expectations/response

-the point is to be different

-don’t take anything at face value, every project is opportunity to learn

Typography: bringing letters to life without being distracting

-text that sparkles on the page

Legible: functional

Readable: you want to keep reading

Composition: how everything relates to each other

You Need:

1. harmony + unity
    
2. type that sparkles 
    
3. language + grammar
    

1. clear sense of clusters
    
2. clear hierarchy
    
3. asymmetrical balance
    

Tips:

-is everything 100% necessary?

-scale down for white space

-subtle design

-nothing screaming for attention, everything honoured and respected

-never call attention to your type!

-space around margins

  

Your Own Forensic:

You MUST once you have a composition basically in place, ASK and check: 

1. How’s the space?
    
2. Are things randomly placed?
    
3. Are things “floating”?
    
4. Have you used “tension and locking” to lock thing down to edges, without creating issue of “visual weight” with things “pulling” to much, into corners?
    
5. How’s the hierarchy, clustering? Is it Balanced? It is Asymmetrical?
    
6. IS there a clear guiding underlying structure holding it together? ACROSS the entire spread?
    
7. Are you making sure to not right angle elements that could use overlap to “stitch’ the space together?
    
8. Is there clear “hotspots” in the photographs? Are these being used to determine the underlying structure that is governing the space?
    
9. Do the photographs use SCALE (large and small, near and far, dark and light) to FULL effect?
    
10. Do your photographs have hotspots? CLEAR hotspots we can see?
    
11. Do your photographs have lots of options for hotspots, some you CHOSE not to use or reinforce because you thought about the effect on the opposite side of the composition (image #1 > Image #2 and resultant space) ? 
    
12. Do your photographs you chose have CONTRASTS within them? In relationship between the TWO images?
    
13. If things are not working do you know why?
    
14. Can you use the elements and language of design to do the forensic to make it work better? Or are you just “moving things around”?
    
15. Have you taken the time to find great images?
    
16. Have you eliminated background distractions so that we can focus on the human figure and faces ?
    

Once you ASK: then Do something about it if need be and EDIT. 

  

Brodovitch Method:

1. good quality image?
    
2. contrast in image?
    
3. what goes down first?
    
4. clear hotspots in pictures?
    
5. underlying structure?
    
6. resize/crop/change images
    
7. generous whitespace
    
8. refine until it feels right
    

*attention to detail, no detail = no design*

*nothing is arbitrary*

  

Grammar:

1. hierarchy
    
2. clusters
    
3. asymmetrical balance
    
4. overlapping planes
    
5. underlying structure
    
6. rule of thirds
    
7. tension and locking
    
8. hotspots
    
9. contrasts
    

  

*create harmony and unity by successfully employing the language, grammar and Brodovitch Method to make space*

  

*go beyond the surface*-
