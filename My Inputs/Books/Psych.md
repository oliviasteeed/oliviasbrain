## Notes

## Intro
- the origin of the universe book
- critique of pure reason book
- admiration and awe from starry heavens above and morality within

Materialist - mind as physical thing
Evolutionary - behaviour as product of evolution, natural selection
Â Causal - thoughts/actions are products of genes and upbringingÂ 

> "we know so much about the physical world and so little about mental life"

## Foundations
## Neuroscience - Brain makes thought
- Finneas Gage - got iron through head and became immature and selfish, the physical body is ourself
- Greg F - restless and rebellious teenager, left school to join hare krischna, slowly began to go blind and treated as spiritual event, "like he was scooped out, hollow inside", had brain tumour and lost memory and feeling
- the astonishing hypothesis - everything you are is just neurons and electrical impulses, materialism, believe animals are 'beast machines' with no soul or intention, you are confined to body
- dualism - mind and soul are distinct, present in most religions and philosophy systems, we are not physical things because we have control of the self - soul distinct from body, soul inhabits body, allows you to evade death
> "maybe the universe was created 5 seconds ago and all our memories are false"
- heart v head - where are "you"?/where do soul and body meet - past belief was heart, now know it is brain

- science fiction short story terry bisset
> "meat made the machines... you're asking me to believe in sentient meat?"

The Logistics - neurons !!
- neuron yeah yeah dendrite to axon electrical impulse myelin sheath
- sensory neuron - in, motor neuron - out, interneuron - neuron to neuron (thinking)
- intensity from amount of neurons and firing frequency
- don't touch - synapse, neurotransmitters cross synapse and cause exhititory or inhibitory response
- HIP brain as computer, "computing" is just manipulating symbols, processing input - memory very different
- cerebral cortex - higher order, newest
- subcortical - more basic survival
- the man who mistook his wife's face for a hat book - agnosia - see parts but cannot bring into a whole
- right brained/left brained is fake
- differences are inborn and learned, learning to read reshapes the brain and pushes face recognition to right
- information travels through corpus collosum, alien hand syndrome - two parts of brain are no longer in unison, each half of brain is own self - language using self and other self
- everything changes the brain - memory/experience changes structure of brain

## Consciousness - a quirky diversion
- cognitive psychologists reject consciousness because it cannot be observed, only focus on brain science
- entangled life book about fungi
- you can have intelligence without consciousness/sentience - fungi can do a maze, slime moulds put at major cities emulate major roadways and transit systems so are now used to plan transit (this is wild),Â what even is inteligence though?
- conscience - not about intelligence but if others can suffer
> "fundamentally first person event" - cannot prove anyone else is conscious
> "if you worry about this you're on your way to being a philosopher" lol
- prefrontal cortex - adult control of conscious attentiom, baby is trapped in here and now -Â will we stop being able to do this?Â 
- temporal experience - CFF speed of flashing light looking constant (60 for humans, 80 for dogs, do they see us in slow mo?)
- frequency of brain waves correspond to how conscious you are, different brain parts activate to different attention so in mri they can know what you are thinking about
- global workspace theory - sensory areas of brain are activated in reponse to world stimuli, when focused on prefrontal and pariental light up and directed to appropriate brain region/enters consciousness
- computational view - computer could be conscious and mechanics don't matter (neurons v silicon)
- physical view - consciousness is product of physical brain like digestion and mitosis, computer can never be sentient
- we can never tell what is right - how do you know someone else is conscious
- 'easy' problems - performance of functions of perceptual experience
- hard problems - how we categorize and experience consciousness
- phenomenal consciousness - experienceÂ 
- access consciousness - awareness, limited focus - cannot attend to two things at once, figure and ground depending on focus
- cocktail party effect - what you aren't focusing on is subconsciously aware, comes to consciousness only when stands out (name or taboo phrase), gorilla video lol
- feels like we are conscious of whole world when we actually only see a small spotlight
- repeated actions become habitual/automatic to free up our consciousness, habit liberates us - the way to find goodness is making the right choice automatic
- difference between ai and automatic actions?
- morning is easiest time to implement thoughtless routine
- mastermind book
- "choice of attention is to the inner like what choice of action is to the outer"
- be careful - automatic actions become almost impossible to not do (reading/listening - stroop effect)
- drunk book
- being in crowd reduces self consciousness
- pain makes you present
- spotlight effect - assume everyone is watching your good and bad moments - in reality everyone just cares about themself - this bias is because there is no experience in your life you have not been at the absolute center of
- a healthy mind supresses some thoughts for your own good, helps you decieve others by deceiving yourself (hares run randomly when being chased - literally don't know where they will go next)

## Freud and the unconscious
- the einstein of psychology
- complexes -
