## Notes

## Intro
- the origin of the universe book
- critique of pure reason book
- admiration and awe from starry heavens above and morality within

Materialist - mind as physical thing
Evolutionary - behaviour as product of evolution, natural selection
Â Causal - thoughts/actions are products of genes and upbringingÂ 

> "we know so much about the physical world and so little about mental life"

## Foundations
## Neuroscience - Brain makes thought
- Finneas Gage - got iron through head and became immature and selfish, the physical body is ourself
- Greg F - restless and rebellious teenager, left school to join hare krischna, slowly began to go blind and treated as spiritual event, "like he was scooped out, hollow inside", had brain tumour and lost memory and feeling
- the astonishing hypothesis - everything you are is just neurons and electrical impulses, materialism, believe animals are 'beast machines' with no soul or intention, you are confined to body
- dualism - mind and soul are distinct, present in most religions and philosophy systems, we are not physical things because we have control of the self - soul distinct from body, soul inhabits body, allows you to evade death
- "maybe the universe was created 5 seconds ago and all our memories are false"
- heart v head - where are "you"?/where do soul and body meet - past belief was heart, now know it is brain
- science fiction short story terry bisset - "meat made the machines... you're asking me to believe in sentient meat"

More Neuroscience
- neuron yeah yeah dendrite to axon electrical impulse myelin sheath
- sensory neuron - in, motor neuron - out, interneuron - neuron to neuron (thinking)
- intensity from amount of neurons and firing frequency
- don't touch - synapse, neurotransmitters cross synapse and cause exhititory or inhibitory response
- HIP brain as computer, "computing" is just manipulating symbols, processing input - memory very different
- cerebral cortex - higher order, newest
- subcortical - more basic survival
- the man who mistook his wife's face for a hat book - agnosia - see parts but cannot bring into a whole
- right brained/left brained is fake
- differences are inborn and learned, learning to read reshapes the brain and pushes face recognition to right
- information travels through corpus collosum, alien hand syndrome - two parts of brain are no longer in unison, each half of brain is own self - language using self and other self
- everything changes the brain - memory/experience changes structure of brain

## Consciousness
- entangled life book about fungi
- you can have intelligence without consciousness - fungi can do a maze, _although what even is inteligence?_
- conscience - not about intelligence but if others can suffer
