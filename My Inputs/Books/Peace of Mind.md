## Summary

### Context
- book about Buddhist mindfulness by Thich Nhat Hanh, specifically concerning mind-body connection with meditation exercises.
### Main Takeaways
- becoming aware of breathing and body creates happiness from the inside
- you don't have to wait â€“ it is already within you
- focus is the asset, time passes anyways but focus is fleeting
- breathe in: "I am my body", breathe out: "I am the universe"
- happiness is freedom and freedom is a habit
- take care of negative emotions
### Questions/Connections/Thoughts
- this book assumes readers are able-bodied (mentions be grateful for legs that work, vision, etc...) is this problematic? Yes enjoying able-bodiedness creates joy but also implies being disabled is to lack that capacity? Not really though cause there's always some joy you're taking for granted.
- how long will the epiphany last?
