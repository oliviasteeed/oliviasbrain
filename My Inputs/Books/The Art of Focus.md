## Notes
- so it's still always about money
> “Instead, I am here to bring clarity in a time of external chaos, distraction,
and opportunity overwhelm. I am here to help you join the rich. The New
Rich. The rich that don’t care to be rich, and that’s why they’re rich in more
domains than money.”

- letting things last is complacency
> “All  of  them put off this sense of unease. A subtle projection of their deep internal state of  unhappiness.  They  seemed  to  let  momentary inconveniences  turn  into lifelong problems.”

- seeing unhappy, unfulfilled parents gets divorced makes you think you cannot ve happy doing the same insignificant things and you have to be something special to achieve the greatness they couldn't

> “There doesn’t seem to be a more worthwhile endeavor to dedicate your life to than to see what you are capable of.”
> "It will take your whole life because that is the point of it"

- very easy in contemporary Western society to stay on hedonic treadmill without looking up

- forgetting that there can be more
> “The concept of one’s “life’s work” has been lost by all but those who learn
to focus. Everyone has been made to believe that their life is out of their
control,  that  there  is  a  set  path  to  follow  that  will  result  in  eventual happiness.”

> “Humans  can  process  10–50  bits  of  information  per  second  with  their
conscious  attention.  The  what,  how,  and  why  behind  that  information  we
choose to process will determine our quality of life. That is, what we hold
in our attention, how we interpret that information, and why we gave it our
attention in the first place is of utmost importance. Focus is attention with
intention.”

- why not?
- question everything, keep an open mind
