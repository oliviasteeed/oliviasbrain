## Notes
4 life classrooms that teach you something, if you don't learn what you need you go back to stage
### 1 Preparing for Love
- weeklong audit of how much time spent alone and how you feel during
- then add new alone activity each week - allows you to enter experiences fully, not distracted by others
- loneliness (sadness) v solitude (joy) journey
#### presence
- being distracted from self does not count as solitude
- tune in and identify the values reflected by your actions
- reflect on values with: time choices, travel, social media, tv, punctality, planning, organization, exercise, food, sleep, money, purchase planning, social interaction, family, conversation
#### discomfort
- uncomfortable at first, doesn't feel productive
- practice: commit to developing new skill, travel alone, take on job you've never done - see what aspects of yourself don't change
#### confidence
- **[[Confidence]] is self assurance from appreciation of competence**
- change mindset or what you don't like - center goals on growth not achievement
self areas - assess biggest growth areas
- self
- financial
- mental/emotional
- health
- relationships
#### 3 Cs of transformation
- coaching - ger expert advice
- consistency - goal tied to action items not achievements
- community - with othersÂ 
- being alone makes you rely fully on yourself - capability
- solitude makes space between perception and action
- don't want to mould yourself into someone else because you don't know who you are
- desire is something we project
- attraction and reaction - self control and patience- don't get carried away but what attracts you, what is fulfilling feels hard before and good after
- journey with not making them a journey

### rule 2: do not be led by karma
- karma is tool to teach you what you need to know
- what we experience creates impression that shape future decision making/behaviour - doesn't mean it's true or unchanging, ask if it's working for you and make new ones
- embrace younger self, what did they need to hear that they were never told? what would they say in response?
- if parents loved you you might be a kind person or might hold everyone to an impossible standard - gifts and gaps
#### influences on impressions
parents
- learn what love is from them, repeat it if don't tune into inner child impressions. parents are first love, teacher, guru
- play out unconscious knowledge in every unthinking move we make
- parental gaps - look for others to give, parental gifts - look for others to fill

media
- look first for parents to identify gaps, then others, then self
- know your gaps to understand what you need from others (learned from childhood/experience)
- priming/contextual effects - holding hot drink makes you rate people as more attractive, rate people closer to your definition of average as more attractive
- face value book - first impressions are usually wrong
- before ww2 only 15% of rings is diamond, diamond industry made up 2 months salary and diamond ring engagement norm
- question media depictions - what do they make you expect

first love
- pfc not developed until 25 - young people think with feelings in amygdala - remembered as more intense than adult logical love
levels of intelligence
- learn from others
- learn from experience
- don't learn

- frustration attraction - playing hard to get amplifies feelings for others
- why him why her book

- be conscious of why you're choosing them
archetypes - fill a void/role but is it really what you want? (no)
- the rebel
- the chase
- the project
- the fuckboy/fuckgirl
- the oppulent one
oppulences
- knowledge
- fame
- money
- beautyÂ 
- strength
- renunciation

- **we get what we are attracted to** - if you are attracted to someone ambitious they will be ambitious and not spend as much time with you
- if you put something into the world you get it back - **- what you present your value as people will value you for** (if you use your body to impress that's all they'll want etc) - saying "this is the version of me that i want you to like"
- present as person you are to be attracted to not what you think they will wantÂ 
- list all your positive qualities (not oppulences) - **want to build relationship where you are loved for what you love about yourself**
- requires loving yourself first, fill your own gaps (from parents, media, first love - what outdated/inherited impressions are you carrying?

what role do you play?
- fixer - parental mentality
- dependent - rely on partner to figure it out for you
- supporter - equals with partner, partners champion

- oxytocin makes you feel more in love, amplifies current feelings, men have less but sex amplifies it 500%
- halo effect - one trait biases whole perception

what energy where you in when you started dating?
- energy of ignorance - bored/lonely
- energy of passion - want one of opulences, tied to temporary characteristics
- energy of goodness - connected and compatible, end with respect

### Filling in the gaps
- we need to be loved, respected and appreciated. start a habit of doing this yourself
- write a love letter to yourself/thanking yourself - "we've been through a lot together - everything in fact"
- keep a record of your accomplishments to feel more capable and worthy of respect
3 minutes at start and end of day
- start of day: pick one act you can do to change your day for the better
- end of day: reflect on action - did it serve you?
- breathing meditation - body scan and gratitude for all body parts, "i'm grateful for the richness you allow me to experience"

- exuberance at self - show yourself the care of a love

- everyone's definition of love is different - "i love you" means something different to every person (doesn't mean commitment or wanting longlasting relationship) - as soon as you say that you need to live up to their definition of love
- men usually say i love you first - average of 88 days, a third say it within first month
- women say i love you on average 134 days

- examine personal definition of love - what does it mean to you? what do you expect? 
4 stages of love of divine
- spark of faith
- desiring to associate
- devotional acts - free from material needs
- attachment - pure love of the divine

### 4 phases of love relationships - know phases to identify if it's love
#### attraction
- lust is placing desire for person on someone, regulated by testosterone/estrogen, actually less dopamine (more anxiety)
- deep conversations correlate with higher wellbeing
- vulnerability - reciprocal escalating self-disclosure  
- 3 dates are enough to tell if you're a match (not necessarily sequential, just three that focus on these things)
date 1
- assess personality - who they have been, do you have fun together? 
- what is best meal you ever had? what do you wish you learned more about? what's something you love to do? what are you occupied with now? do you have a favourite place?
- are they curious about you?
- answer questions before and assess what values they project about you
date 2
- assess values - who they are now
- values, risk, character
- whos the most fascinating person you've ever met? what's the most out of character thing you've ever done? what was the biggest plot twist in your life? if you won the lottery what would you spend it on? what makes you proud? what was a tough thing you got through? what would you do if you didn't need to work? 
- keep it playful
date 3
- goals - ideas for future
- do you have a dream you want to fulfill someday? if you could be anyone who would you be? what would you like to change about your life? is there a moment or experience that changes your life? who was your greatest teacher?
- don't have to share goals, just have to respect and be interested in them
#### dreams
- fantasize about relationship we could have
- often have checklist of unrealistic expectations (tied to oppulences) - relationshopping online looking for perfect person
- everyone comes with a past just like you
- different people can fill different needs - happiest people have multiple close relationships
- expect partner to read our minds 
- **how you handle differences is more important than your similaries**
- establish rhythms and routines together, setting healthy boundaries and observing how they respond
- in the start only see them once a week, set schedule of communication frequency - um fuck this, logistics are so unromantic
- if deeper topics scare someone off, good
- **instead of letting things happen and worrying just say how you feel/what you need.** - clarity
#### struggle and growth
- discover ways you aren't aligned - do you want to put in the effort
- means valuing someone enough to invite discomfort and differences - growth
- understand where rituals come from - upbringing
- leave relationship, work through together (more resilient love), ignore and suffer (don't do this)
#### trust
- increases gradually
- begins with us being trustworthy - follow through on word/promises to yourself and trust yourself to take care of yourself
- physical - safe in presence
- mental - ideas and way they make decisions
- emotional - values/who they are
- notice/recognize when someone follows through on a promise - don't only show appreciation for surprises, intentional recognition of who they are and what they do for us
- an hour each month to reflect on relationship - highlight, challenge, thing to work for
- ongoing growth is the true fun of love - not just flirting
- "if you never commit you never get to love"

## rule 4: your partner is your guru
- love is not gazing at each other but looking outwards together (Antoine de St Exupery)
- [[Egocentric bias]] - see others through bias of how we see ourselves
- practice seeing ourselves through their eyes, observe their behaviour toward us and learn lesson they are teaching us
- author's wife didn't celebrate his success - realized this meant she loved him for him not his accomplishments and became grateful
- [[Self-expansion theory]] - desire for relationships to expand sense of self, want someone who brings something you don't have
can you grow with them?
- do they like to learn about themself?
- do they understand their emotions?
- do they try to understand you?
- can they entertain themselves (parallel growth journey)
- are they open to finding new ways of solving problems?
- do they support others in growth?
- do they make you ambitious

being a better guru
- do not lead, serve
- lead by example
- help them get to their goals, not ours
- move at pace of student

- understand underlying desire from dreams/ambitions
- help them pursue their purpose

## rule 5: find your purpose
- dharma - passion, expertise, service
- meaning of life to find gift, purpose giving it away
- purpose, money, pleasure, spirit
- hedonia v eudamonia - self esteem from purpose
- best relationships are two people with independent purposes - helping each other reach purpose, supporting from sidelines when taking calculated risks, not overly concerned or pressuring
- instead of pulling them away from purpose join them on journey - having your own purpose helps avoid jealousy
- find mentor to share how they made it - skills to develop
- spend 0.1% on the podium, other time training
journey to dharma
- learn
- experiment
- perform - only as good as learning and experimenting - put a timeframe on it to minimize anxiety/unknown
- struggle

- khan academy - it was a calling

- you're doing this together
- we complain at small issues instead of celebrating wins we have
- write a love letter to your person - "our love isn't a relationship, it's a becoming"
- gratefulness meditation - come up with 10 unique things you love about them
- [[Numbered list isn't great framework with audio]]

## rule 6: win or lose together
- avoiding conflict robs you of understanding each other
- top 3 areas - money, sex, raising kids
- get to core of issue - small arguments are really about the bigger things
- the two of you vs the problem - you both win or lose
- conflict is not abuse - fights can make relationship stronger
what energy are you in?
- ignorance -pointless argument
- passion - power argument
- goodness -argument looking for resolution - productive

- ego-driven argument you always lose
- seek to understand not win
- rise to neutrality - responsibility to mediate

conflict
- social - external
- interpersonal - between each other
- inner - in self

- don't waste time arguing about things you don't care about - find the root cause not symptom

fight style
- venting - express and solution immediately
- hiding - shut down, need to calm down before solutioning
- exploding - burst of emotions, take a time out before discussion

- schedule discussion - can we talk about blank, find a time where you are both mentally prepared, neutral location
- most fights start with "you always"
- avoid i and you - use we to not put people on the defensive
- say "i feel" - not statements of fact but statements of how you feel
- share how you feel and need and find out how they feel and what they need from you
- share your intentions - i want to work it out because i care about the relationship
- resolving argument requires committment to change, take responsibility and apologize, commit to change
  
a productive apology
- recognize - genuine regret
- articulate - express behavioural change that will prevent it in future
- action - follow through
- best apology is changed behaviour

- avoid argument addiction - make unsolvable disagreements into neutral zones, make comprimises for each other in these zones


## Rule 7: you don't break in a breakup
- do not let cracks go unresolved
- abuse is any behaviour one partner uses to control the other - relationships are no place for control, question is not if to leave but how to do it safely
- one passive aggressive remark erases 20 acts of kindness
- you can recover from infidelity but it takes 100% commitment from both people - only 1/10 people that leave for someone else actually end up with them, would you leave if there was no other person or are you just dazzled by shiny new person
- lack of interest is from not regularly communicating and connecting - you should be excited to see/talk to them, want to tell them immediately when there's good or bad news, still learning from each other and growing together
- high vibration - gained from continual learning
- you don't learn anything from partner when you stick to same routines, need to continue to learn, share experiences and grow together 
- some form of achievement or service together
- use entertainment as conduit to reflect, only small part of relationship maintenance
- experiences and experimenting (somewhere where you are both novices) are more impactful for building intimacy
- play is best headspace to learn - indirectly teaches you about each other and your relationship
- travelling together increases relationship satisfaction and intimacy
- novel experiences increase attraction to others - misattribution of arousal
- express gratitude for everything partner does - take opportunities to show them appreciation and grow intimacy

options in conflict
- elevate - continue with growb
- separate - break up
- stagnation - letting it fester

partners are not equipped to help you with every aspect of life, you need a support system for:
- self
- financial
- mental/emotional
- health
- relationships

should you break up?
- identify intolerable issue - difference that may be dealbreaker
- do you love them enough to deal with discomfort as you work through issue?
- acknowledge there might be valid reason for intolerable behaviour - understand their reasoning and history
- need to disagree in order to connect - investigate with sincerity, ignoring it just makes it a chronic issue 
- lots of potential argument opportunities - be intentional to avoid them and keep discussions productive
- accept differences between us - appreciate efforts to change, change yourself, comprimise 
- taking the journey together makes you closer and understand each other more. working through intolerable issues together is key opportunity for relationship growth
- challenge might be connected to a reason why you love them

breaking up
- when it will never change
- love gives cocaine signals, literally withdrawal and cravings for them
- no one can break your soul - what you have together is breaking but you are not, you still have your life and purpose, nobody can take that from you
instigator
- deadline for breakup
- be clear and honest
- personality, values, goals - where are the disconnects
- shift life away from each other immediately, take year break before being friends yeesh
dumpee
- creating a story even when not totally true is more healing than freewriting about emotions - do not dwell on only the positive
- walking away doesn't reduce - if you don't properly feel emotions they amplify
- only you can give yourself closure, wanting revenge only gives you bad karma in future
- read story out loud to empty room
- learn karmic lessons

- being single is time to develop friendships and connections so you already feel fulfilled
- set a time limit to work on yourself "i'm not dating until blank time" - gives you permission to focus on othet things

- maya - illusion
- maya of love is we can only access it through certain peope/in relationships, in reality best way to feel love is community and service. best way to obtain health is when health is means to an end
- write heaing lovenote to yourself
- "tribe of the heartbroken" - "once your heart is broken some part of it will always be that way. you may have lost one person but you have gained the world" - everyone can relate on heartbreak - connection to [[longing]]?
- heartbreak breaks you open to world. this is what it's all about
- if you want to feel love, give it. you are always connected to it

## rule 8: love again and again
- life is not a lovestory between you and one other person - lovestory between you and the world
- give love to everyone, their surroundings, the world at large
- best way to experience love is giving it to others, service, higher purpose
-  everyone's actions are opportunity to give love and reach core of love
- look beyond own needs, goal of service, serve together to deepen connection
- infinite expansion of love
- easier to empathize with individuals than large groups - [[Compassion Collapse]]

how to love - 4 key qualities
- understanding - listening with curiosity
- belief - support/potential
- acceptance - let them be them
- appreciation - tell them what they have done well

- radius of respect - those who need the most love ask for it in the most unloving ways (lashing out) 
- don't be brought down - may need different levels of closeness to love them best
- people project their viewpoint/biases onto you - stop expecting others to support and accept you exactly, work on your own confidence so it doesn't matter
- one of best way to love difficult person is find other sources of love for them - community instead of one on one love
- people can only handle 150 connections (in levels of closeness - closest, friends, meaningful contacts, aquaintances, recognize - consciously decide who you want to see and how often)
- only can really have 5 closest people
- make eye contact and smile at strangers to put people at ease and spread love - **being ignored has mood effect**, even by stranger
- service doesn't have to be organized, just take action and help those around you
- we are not trained to take responsibility for earth - first nations have nature worshipping practices, opposition between light and darkness has shaped every spiritual practice
- sunlight sets circadian rhythm and impacts mood and metabolism - the sun is controlling you
- "light hunger" when we don't get enough sunlight

- "how can i love everyone here today?" - activate people, make them feel seen, makes you experience depths of love in every area of life
- write love letter to world - what connects us all is our connection to love, offer everyone love fully without reservation
- radiate, love body scan meditation
