## Notes
- culture has an issue with pleasure - build lives around productivity and money, ignore pleasure because it is unquantifiable - reclaim pleasure

**Sex IQ Pillars
Embodiment**
- counteracted with numbing behaviours
- mindful movement - focus on how feeling
- meditation - letting to thoughts to "simply be", in morning and night
- breathwork - breathe deeper and longer, catch yourself holding your breath, 4-7-8 breathing, box breathing (4)
**Health**
- healthy food, exercise (cardio and weights), sleep, nature, social connections
- hormones - impact desire, reduce sugar, exercise, sleep to regulate, be in tune with cycle as woman
- estrogen - thalides from
- bpa and personal care products replace in body, low esteogen means low libido
- birth control reduces testosterone and dopamine permenantly!! - less libido and happiness
- attracted to men looking more testosterone-y when not on pill with different hormonal cycles, when stop taking not attracted anymore
- gut biome
**Collaboration**
- creating intimacy and closeness in other areas too
- communicate about sex
- sexual energy - built in intimacy and connection
- subtle body book
- polarity - opposite energies - masculine and femininity (not tied to gender)
- masculine - dominant
- feminine - submissive
- take turns with these energies to increase polarity and attraction
- know what turns you on - shared experience, flirting, connection, safety, role play, mystery
**Self knowledge**
- core desires - what we want from sex, foundation in childhood (adored, naughty, accepted) - find out by asking what are your hottest fantasies? 
- desire to ejaculate on partner's face is really core desire for acceptance ðŸ’€
**Self acceptance** - neutrality
- need to think you are worthy
- sexual confidence comes with age and experience
- even the parts you dislike deserve pleasure
- neutralize self cricicism with affirmation and gratitude

- need to have desire to be aroused
- desire - want sex
- arousal - sex organs activated
- spontaneous desire - immediate, in beginning, more common for men
- responsive desire - need more foreplay to get aroused, more common for women

- ignoring body signals makes you blind to embodiment. don't be floating brain but a whole being 

## fight off pleasure theives
- enjoy your life!
**pleasure theives**
- **stress** - normalized and celebrated in our culture but doesn't have to be, stress (sympathetic fight or flight) destroys pleasure (parasympathetic rest and digest). socialization leads to oxytocin which leads to more oxytocin
- **trauma** - big T and little t traumas add up, lead to involuntary learned responses when triggered, lead to anxiety in relationships
- the body keeps the score book
- **shame** - i am something bad, unattractive, dirty - is there something wrong with me? taking on narrative as truth
- rejection - fear of fundamentally unlovable
- exposure - fear of vulnerability
- self blame - fear of letting people down/responsibility for actions of others
- internalized judgment - fear of being abnormal, body insecurity from mainstream media only portraying certain kind of body deserving pleasure
- things can be normalized or common but there is no normal
- shame framed as moral good (shameless means wrong)
- guilt - i did something bad

- more pleasure means more productivity and wellbeing - aim for 25% of waking hours in pleasure

## You do you
- self love sesh to learn what you like
- meditate, masterbate, manifest - use orgasm to manifest goals
- manifestation -if you can visualize it it is already done

## Communication
- sexual problems are actually about communication, that's the sauce
- talk about it before getting intimate - do they have a sex growth mindset
- add 3 sex positive voices to your life to normalize sex talk
- is your body saying hell yes or hell no? ask for a break and check in with your body

## Ethical nonmonogamy
- helps with communication, can make you closer
- how important is approval?
- more deep connections not just more sex

## General advice
- put them at ease - brain is biggest block, pause and affirm
- enthusiasm over technique
- if you are anxious the blood rushes to your head not genitals
