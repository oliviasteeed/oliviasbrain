## Notes
- 80% of career success is from ability to deal with people, enthuse, lead - this is a commodity more valuable than anything else
## Get what you want
1. don't criticize, condemn or complain
- change behaviour with compassion and positive reinforcement, criticism leads to self justification and vilainization of you - all the criminals think they are being targeted unjustly
> "any fool can criticize, condemn and complain, and most fools do, but it takes character and self control to be forgiving"
- habit of criticism - holding others to standards that don't match context
- don't criticize, condemn or complain
- give people what they want
- everyone wants to feel important - desire to be great, craving to be appreciated, most is unrealized
- how you get your feeling of importance determines your character
- people may go insane to find in dreamland of insanity the importance they have been denied in daily life - nothing actually wrong with their brain, find feeling of importance they cannot find in reality
- criticism destroys motivation, praise and sincere appreciation makes people want to impress and work hard

2. give honest sincere appreciation
- appreciate for what they do have, they will want to do more for you
- people are starving for self esteem food
- flattery is counterfeit - will eventually get you into trouble, only genuine appreciation will lead to good
- this is a new way of life - think about others instead of ourselves, give approval and interest - notice what other people are doing
- ===you only pass this way once so don't save any good for later==
- everyone you meet is your superior in some way - try to learn from them

3. arouse an eager want
- ==everyone just cares about what they want== - tell them how it gets them closer or farther from what they want to make them care - if you can make people want something you can have anything
- one secret of success is ability to see other person's pov - talk to them about what they want
> "self expression is the dominant necessity of human nature"

## 6 ways to make people like you
1. Be interested in them
- you can make more friends being interested in other people than finding people interested in you
- people who aren't interested in others have the most difficulty, cause the most harm and are responsible for the failures of humanity
- say thank you and i love my audience to make them like you
- be interested in everyone, everyone likes people that admire them, greet people with animation, enthusiasm, warmth
- we are interested in those that are interested in us

2. smile at them
- people rarely succeed at something if they don't have fun doing it
- smile at people, if you want them to have fun meeting you have fun meeting them
- action and feeling are a two way street - happiness depends on inner conditions
- smile is warmth in cold world

3. remember people's names
- look at it, align it to their features
- people are most interested in their own names, immediately makes them feel unique and important

4. all people want is a good listener
- a good conversationalist is just someone who listens actively
- during the conversation, nothing else is as important as the person you are talking to
- love is dropping everything to listen
- listening diffuses the situation or conflict
- concentrated attention and appreciation
> "you have no idea how much it means to be listened to"
- to be interesting, be interested - ask questions they will enjoy answering

5. interest people
- road to person's heart is to talk about what they care about most - read up on it to prepare
- share and ask about what you admire about others
- law: always make the other feel important
- literally just do for others what you would like them to do for you - all the time, everywhere
- little courtesies during speech - i'm sorry to trouble you but, if you don't mind, thank you

6. make the other person feel important and do it sincerely
- ask about what they want to share about

## How to win people over
1. the only way to win an argument is to avoid
- ==you can't win an argument - if you lose you lose, if you win you still lose because being forced to agree does not change your opinion==
- just agree and then they run out of things to say, then put in your point
- argument is "academic theatrical victory" *and that is why I enjoy?*
- hatred is ended by love - see and validate their point of view
> "when two people always agree, one of them is not necessary"
- listen first, do not resist, look for areas of agreement, admit error and apologize for mistakes, genuinely consider their points, thank them for their interest - postpone action to give time for thought, could they be right? will reaction bring them closer or father? 
- rule when one yells the other should listen

2. don't tell people they're wrong
- admit you may be wrong and examine the facts together - both of you vs untruth
- telling people they are wrong makes them defensive and ignore you
- permit yourself to understand what things mean to other people instead of immediately judging right or wrong to you
- will not persuade, persuasion needs to be on the same side
- read Benjamin Franklin's biography

3. respect the opinions of others
- get rid of fixed opinion statements, stay open, deny yourself the pleasure of contradiction - instead be curious
- leave room for the opinion and problems of others - let them develop your system themselves and sell it to themselves
- listen

4. if you're wrong admit it
- just say you're wrong and they are right, they will respond gracious
- say about yourself all the condemnation you know others will say about you before they say it - they will reel back
- just blame yourself and seek resolution
- convince them you are on their side, then it's much easier to persuade when you're on the same side and they like you
- gentleness is stronger than fury - the sun makes you take of your coat not wind

5. begin in a friendly way
- both striving for same thing
- when people say no they are on guard and motivated to maintain their stance - saying yes in the start primes them to listen and consider you

6. socratic method yes yes technique - get them to agree off the bat on other statements (foot in the door?)

7. let the other person talk themself out
- let them do the talking - talk themselves into it
- ask about their joys

8. let people sell themself
- tell people what you will do for them, then asked what you can expect from them
- cater to them not you, how can you meet their needs?
- let the other person believe the idea was theirs
> "in every work of genius we recognize our own alienated thoughts"
> "he didn't care about credit, he cared about results"

9. validate other people's perspectives - try honestly to see things from other people's point of view
- don't condemn people you disagree with - "any fool can do that"
- how to turn people into gold book
> =="stop a minute to contrast your keen interest in your own affairs with your mild concern about anything else. realize then that everybody else in the world feels exactly the same way"==
- dealing with others means understanding their viewpoint
- start conversation by acknowledging the other person's viewpoint as just as important as your own

10. be sympathetic with their ideas and desires
> "the only reason, for example, that you are not a rattlesnake, is that your mother and father weren't rattlesnakes. you deserve very little credit for being what you are."
- people you disagree with are products of their genes and environment - give them sympathy, they want it
- be above fools
- make it into a kind of game to bring people down from upset - kill em with kindness and listen - makes it difficult for them to villainize you
- you get more fun out of making people like you
- educational psychology book
- the human species universally craves sympathy

11. appeal to desire for morality
- a person always has two reasons for doing something - one to make them feel good and a real one, appeal to the one that makes them feel good

12. dramaticize - people love romanticism

13. stimulate competition for excellence - the work is the deciding factor, the work is the game

## How to be a Leader

1. begin with praise, recognize their competence
> "a barber lathers a man before he shaves him"

2. change but to and - don't infer failure
3. call attention to mistakes indirectly
4. call attention to your own mistakes
5. ask questions instead of giving direct orders - let them feel involved in decision making
6. let the other person save face - you have no right to make them question their dignity
7. use praise instead or condemnation - praise the smallest improvement and every improvement
- i ain't much baby but i'm all i've got book
- praise is warm sunshine
- BF Skinner - we repeat what is praised, we stop what isn't
- praise a specific accomplishment - comes across as sincere
- be sincere - not a bag of tricks, a new way of life

> "compared to what we ought to be we are only half awake" - we possess powers that we do not use enough, one of them is praiseÂ 

8. give people a high reputation to live up to, if you want to improve them in some way assume they already have the characteristics

9. telling people they are bad at something destroys all incentive to improve, tell them they have a natural flair for it and they will try to nurture it
- make the faults seem easy to correct

10. always make the other person happy to do what you want them to
- emphasize how they personally will benefit
