## Summary
### Context
- The Development of Meaning is a 1977 account of several studies led by Dr. Joan Tough, a lecturer and researcher in education. The studies follow a group of similarly outgoing and intelligent children from ‘advantaged’ and ‘disadvantaged’ backgrounds (the only difference being parental education and profession) from age 3 to 7.5 to examine the differences in language development and expression that later influence the understanding of concepts and formation of personal meanings. Children were brought into a lab setting and encouraged to use language with games and social activities, then their utterances were analyzed in content and length to compare the expressions of the two groups, and the implications on conceptual understanding.
### Main Takeaways
- Socioeconomic status influences children's imagination development which impacts empathy and reflectiveness in adulthood.

## Notes

When explaining the way children develop an understanding of grammar, Tough mentions ==“although Russian is a strongly inflected language, where word order has little importance, children at first order their words on the model ‘actor-action-acted upon’ in the same way that children are seen ordering their first utterances in English.==” (p16). This suggests that there is an innate way of understanding and conceptualizing actions that is shared universally. I wonder if this is still true, or if cross-cultural studies show variation. I would expect in collectivist cultures, the order may be reversed, as the focus of attention is generally more on the context than the actor. 

In discussing the differences already studied among ‘advantaged’ and ‘disadvantaged’ groups of children, Tough notes ==“a trend was discovered that pointed to the fact that the middle-class children more frequently chose a noun for making reference, whereas the working-class children tended more frequently to use pronouns for reference.==” (p22), and she goes on to suggest that ==“middle-class children achieve more specificity and elaboration.==” (p23). I wonder why this is. Are middle-class kids encouraged to speak more?

Tough later elaborates on this tendency, using class as a lens to examine expressiveness. She explains that individuals in the middle-class experience more opportunities for autonomy over their futures, thus leading to more expression and explicitness. Tough writes ==“the need for motives and values to be understood by children leads to the expression of feelings, and so to empathy, and the appeal for understanding is directed to the individual. This explicitness is essential, for the basis of understanding is, as it were, a theoretical approach to problems, and an examination of general principles and possible alternative interpretations and consequences that might arise from different courses of action and behaviour.==” (p29). Essentially, if you can’t have it now, you can get it later. Tough contrasts this with the realities of working-class individuals, asserting ==“the lower working class accept the restricted range of occupations open to them; work is the reality over which they have little control; they see little choice and prospect of change, so their hopes and ambitions are inevitably limited.==” (p29). Because there is little hope of change, individuals are limited to predefined social roles and not encouraged to examine or reflect on different possibilities, because they are likely out of reach. These attitudes change how people conceptualize events and actions for the rest of their lives. We are never equal.

Joan summarizes this concept by writing ==“it is the expectations and aspirations of people that are different and it is these differences that lead to different views of relationships with others.==” (p30). We really do create our reality through our expectations, and we also change the lives of others by limiting them to act in accordance with our preconceptions.

In a discussion of how ‘meaning’ develops, Tough cites Roger Brown’s concept of ==“the very naming of the components of the world and the classification which ‘concept’ terms offer help the child to extract principles and order the elements of experience.==” (p34). It is only through stuffing the world into boxes that we can make sense of it.

Tough also cites Vygotsky’s view that conceptualization is not simply ==“association, attention, imagery, inference or determining. They are all indispensable, but they are insufficient without the use of the sign or word or the means by which we direct our mental operations, control their course and channel them towards the solution of the problem confronting us. (p35). This implies that without language, we cannot think. What do children feel before they learn language? If we aren’t careful,  language will overpower embodied and sensory perception until we are as cold as machines. There is life outside order, or so I’ve heard.

Another point in Tough’s review of research on language use and meaning is the finding from Luria’s experiments that ==“children responding to a panel of lights, for example, were found to be bringing their actions under much greater control by ‘talking’ to themselves and verbalising instructions to themselves. (p36). Even imposing language on our own actions helps us understand and control them.

In support of the class explanation for language difference above, Tough explains that ==“the language of others, then, direct’s the child’s attention so that he begins to take the perspective of those who talk with him. Where values are expressed, the child begins to attach importance to those aspects valued by adults, and begins to structure his own perceptions differently, putting different interpretation upon what he sees and hears.==” (p36). The way we speak to children literally creates their worldview. This is supported by studies of twins reared apart, in which ==“the world around now seemed to take on a meaning that was different for each twin.==” (p37). Tough concludes by stating ==“the language others are using reveals the kind of value that they set upon aspects of their experiences and upon the worth of other people and the attitudes they take up towards other people.==” (p37). With this in mind, merely speaking feels like an exposure of one’s entire personhood. How invasive to be revealing one’s deepest values as a byproduct of pragmatic communication.

In an examination of the relational aspects of language, Tough notes that in position-oriented families, which enforce a hierarchical dynamic, ==“the behaviour appropriate to the position of each child in the family will be made clear by example, and, as parents seek to control the child’s behaviour, they will appeal to him to behave acceptably, by referring to the characteristics of his role, and to the status and power of other members of the family.==” (p62). By contrast, in a person-oriented family, parents would ==“see the child as a potential adult needing to learn how to be an adult and gradually moving toward this… He is expected almost to take an adult view of himself as a child. This is explained to him why he cannot do the things adults do because he is still a child and he is expected to agree to his own control and regulation.==” (p63). You need freedom to develop autonomy. 

==“The basis of relationships in a [person-oriented] family is the projection into the other’s feelings and anticipated responses, and the recognition of the other’s part in the relationship.==” (p63). Presenting a family as equals, helping each other, is a much better plan to long term control.

==“The position-oriented mother is likely to see the child as a child and to infer that little knowledge is within his reach. She expects him to play with other children because this is the traditional activity for young children, so she releases him from her control quite readily. The parents may not see the child as a developing person to whom knowledge should me made accessible and so may be doing little to help him acquire basic everyday knowledge. 

The person-oriented mother will see her child as a developing individual who is learning to share in the interests of other members of the family. Thus, she tries to make knowledge available to him. She explains phenomena as they arise, they look at books, she is alert to what will interest him, and it all becomes part of her control strategies: appeal to reason, appeal to interest, appeal to participation and agreement and to the basic principles that govern their relationship.==” (p63). Children have to be taught everything, and unintentional censorship based on a reductionist view of the child’s role impedes the development necessary to become a reflective adult.

In more discussion of the social function of language, Tough asserts ==“all children are seeking for recognition as people who matter; all have needs, both physical and psychological needs, and all children seek to establish their rights and worth in the eyes of other people. Much of the child’s use of language is concerned, then, with making others aware of him as a person, and in gaining attention and recognition.==” (p65). Why do we have an innate need to matter? Just being alive isn’t enough, it has to ‘mean something.’

In the discussion of study results, Tough reports ==“the child from the advantaged group is more likely to use speech to project beyond the limits of the immediate situation. Children from the advantaged groups are seen to use language a great deal more than the disadvantaged groups for imaginative projection, particularly in the creation and extension of imagined situations that go beyond the interpretation of concrete materials.==” (p84). How do you bridge the class divide when people structure experience so differently? What a way to keep people divided and static.

Tough draws on Vygotsky again to examine the function of language on the interpretation of experiences. She paraphrases ==“language arises at the point of becoming aware of operating in a particular way, of making judgements, of evaluating and having intentions toward others. The very emergence of language, overtly or covertly, is evidence of the awareness of the self, and of the self’s own actions and intentions. The differences in children in the way in which they interpret situations may be, therefore, not so much evidence of differences in their interpretation of such scenes in terms of needed action, but rather of differences in their awareness of the act they are making judgements about their actions.==” (p101). Considering we experience the world differently from everyone else, it’s a wonder there is any cooperation in the world. Doesn’t it just fill you with empathy?

Tough reports the differences in elaboration in the two groups, namely that the children in the ‘disadvantaged’ group tended to answer in short, vague replies, but could be prompted to share more detail when consistently prompted by experimenters. She writes ==“from the child’s response it would seem that he has the resources with which to make an interpretation, but either he is not aware of his own knowledge and needs help to bring it into a structure that is acknowledged and expressed, or the meaning is at hand but he does not see the necessity for expressing it. He is, therefore, either unaware of the interpretation he might make, or does not feel that it is appropriate to express his interpretation… What can be seen is that the disadvantaged children, at 5 and 7, tended to give short responses which indicated that the picture was interpreted, not as a whole, but object-by-object, and that there was a general failure to infer possible relationships, causes and consequences from the visible evidence. It seems that the children were oriented to examine the situations differently and this was reflected in the more frequent use of different strategies of language.==”  (p103). Are they not listened to or do they just not know to elaborate for lack of modeling?

==“The most important thing about memory is not storage of past experiences, but rather the retrieval of what is relevant in some usable form.==” (p104). 

While examining the use of language to extend the concrete present into hypotheticals, Tough draws on Bruner to explain how initially imagery is used to understand experience, and then is overtaken by language. She cites ==“language comes from the same root out of which symbolically organized experience grew.==” (p105), and goes on to explain ==“we are innately programmed to construct our inner models of the world and our language in the same way. But language and organised symbolic experiences, that is, established images, only begin to relate to one another when the child is between 2 and 3 years old and language not only becomes part of experience but begins to modify it. Language is able to modify experience only because it springs from the same innate capacity of the organism to organize experience, and because meanings for experiences are shared in a social world.==” (p105-106). Finally, ==“as the child’s model of language develops, it converges with the maturing organisation of experience, and the structure of experience. Since the structure demanded by language is often more evident than the structure of experience, so language begins to exert an ordering effect upon experiences.==” (p106). 

Tough illustrates the point above with evidence from her studdy ==“It seems that, as Bruner proposes, language has taken over from imagery, and there may be little vestige of gestures as evidence that the language we are using is supported by images built up from previous experiences. At the age of 3 years the children from the disadvantaged group used language for recalling past experiences infrequently. Now again, at 5, we could see that although all children showed they could refer to past experiences through the use of language, the children in the disadvantaged group used language for this purpose much less readily that children from the advantaged group, and gave less information in their first responses.==” (p112). Before language is used to structure experience we exist in a kind of timeless, orderless, emotional and experiential soup.

In one task in the study, children were given a bottle that could take in and shoot out water as they squeezed, and asked how it worked and why to gauge their understanding through verbal expression. Tough observes that ==“many of the children in the disadvantaged group… tended to so reduce their explanations that it was impossible for the listener to judge how much they understood.==” (p139). She further questions ==“do the children in the disadvantaged group ‘know’ less about the world around them than the advantaged group? Or do they for some reason ‘express’ less about what they ‘know?’ Or is it that their ‘knowing’ is different, that in Bruner’s terms it is within iconic or enactive models of representation(DEFINE ME), and is not readily available within the symbolic mode. Or is it that the child sees this kind of exploration as irrelevant and uninteresting, or sees discussing such matters with adults as inappropriate?==” (p140). Does thinking less actually impact how much you know?

Tough also notes gender differences found in the studies influenced by class ==“there was no difference in the advantaged groups between boys and girls, but in the disadvantaged groups the mean score for girls was 1.5 and boys was 2.1.==” (p140). I wonder if this is due to the strict roles that Tough called characteristic of the disadvantaged groups.

While examining morality and language, Tough refers to Piaget’s concept that ==“conceptual thought arises from the child’s operations on the elements of experience, upon the objects and their attributes, and upon inherent relationships that are transformed by his actions.==” (p141). She goes on to explain that ==“higher order concepts, and those not readily gained by direct experience, are likely to be far more dependent on language for their development.==” (p141). Without language we cannot extend past the immediate reality of experience.

Tough explains that ==“‘objective responsibility’ is the term applied to evaluations that are made in terms of the material results from a particular incident. ‘Subjective responsibility,’ on the other hand, refers to evaluations that are based on the motives that lie behind particular incidents.==” (p143). She goes on to explain ==“unlike concepts that are dependent on concrete, direct, sensory experience for their establishment, moral concepts would seem to depend to a large extent on the kind of interpretation that is laid upon them by others.==” (p148). Worldview is contagious. We start with an objective view of only the results, but absorb the appraisals of others socially, which biases our perceptions. Ironically, without bias our understanding of morality would be nonsensical.

Tough also draws on Kohlberg to explain moral development, citing ==“only as children reach a level of cognitive development at which the meaning of moral concepts can be differentiated from punishment can they attain either a definite hedonism or a degree of disinterested respect for authority.==” (p149). Is moral awareness a prerequisite for hedonism because it assumes you know better?

In discussion of the study observations, Tough explains that the disadvantaged group produced less utterances overall, with the greatest difference in imaginative projection tasks, where ==“the number of words produced by the children in the disadvantaged groups was less than half that produced by the children in the advantaged groups.==” (p158). She goes on to explain ==“it was precisely those uses that were thought to reflect complex thinking that more frequently appeared in the talk of the children in the advantaged groups: little was revealed that could be described as ‘just talk’; all talk was purposeful, even though it was not all at a level of adult thinking.==” (p159). In addition, in a task in which children were told a story and then instructed to retell it to peer, Tough notes ==“a tendency seen in the advantaged group was to reduce the number of words needed, by using words that contracted meaning… Perhaps this is an indication of a development towards a use of concise expressions. There was no evidence of such a development in the stories retold by the children in the disadvantaged groups.==” (p160). This suggests that the children in the advantaged group have a greater understanding of their experience, so are able to reconstruct it more efficiently. Is more utterances evidence of greater understanding, or does greater understanding lead to more confidence in one’s interpretation, and therefore, more utterances?

==“In concrete situations where everyone can see what is going on, communication is not entirely dependent on the words used.==” (p162).

Tough gives examples of children’s speech during play with peers, to illustrate the cases when children in the ‘disadvantaged’ groups used long utterances. She ellaborates ==“what is the motivation for being explicit in these two examples? Each refers to the child’s own involvement in something that matters a great deal to him. In each case he is concerned to maintain his own self-interest. In spontaneous conversations with their friends the longest utterances recorded by the disadvantaged groups all came from this use of language.==” (p165). The reinforcement the self and assurance of fairness is well understood.

Tough eventually explains the difference in utterance length and complexity between the two groups by the way the children view experiences. She explains ==“this view is one that does not impose the same kind of structure and complex meanings on events and situations as children who are at advantage. The disadvantaged children are not inclined to reflect on the meaning of their own experiences, or to project readily on the experiences of others. They do not give explanations and justifications readily, nor do they reflect readily on past experiences, injecting them into the present to illuminate understanding. Not do they anticipate the future readily and plan and consider alternative possibilities. But it would seem it is not necessarily a lack of resources of language that governs what they do.The child’s disadvantage in school seems to stem more from a lack of motivation to think in these ways, from lack of experience of thinking in these ways and from his general lack of awareness of meanings of this kind.==” (p166).  Tough further explains that children in the disadvantaged group evaded answering questions with ‘I don’t know’ type remarks, but could achieve the same level of elaboration when encouraged and prompted, and that the lack of response was due not to lack of ability, but ==“lack of appropriate expectations, or lack of awareness of what they knew.==” (p166). The fixed role in society does not allow for growth.

When comparing the complexity of utterances between the two groups, Tough notes ==“the children in the disadvantaged groups used these features less extensively than the children in the advantaged groups because the purposes for which they generally expected to use language did not require them.==” (p168). 

Tough considers interventions to support children in the disadvantaged groups, and notes that understanding and actively engaging these children is essential. She explains her view that education ought to prepare children to be active agents who can think critically and participate in democracy, stating ==“such objectives are concerned with self-discipline and responsibility, with self-confidence and self-expression, and with developing the ability to reflect, to analyse and to survey causes, to reason and anticipate possible consequences before taking action or reaching decisions. Basic to the development of these skills is the motivation to think critically and to communicate effectively with others.==” (p172-173). Nurturing thoughtful and engaged citizens should be the purpose of general education, not competitive achievement.

Tough explains the importance of reflection and critical thought, citing Bruner again ==“there are doubtless many ways in which a human being can serve as a vicar for culture, helping a child to understand its point of view and the nature of knowledge. But I dare say that few are so potentially powerful as participating in dialogue.==” (p174). She explains how this necessitates appreciating and anticipating what one’s listeners know and understand to inform the creation of utterances, which children in the disadvantaged group did not display often. Extending past egocentrism, to the experience of the other requires the ability to consider a reality other than your own.  Empathy is a prerequisite to communicating effectively. Somehow everything comes back to those damn design thinking hexagons.
  
==“Each individual has within him what is described by Kellner as his own ‘subjective texture of meanings’.==” (p175). 

To build the ability to reflect, Tough asserts ==“the child needs continual encouragement to make an internal inspection of his own experiences and ideas. The child also needs help if he is to project beyond himself and his own experiences.==” (p176), and she explains this can include engaging in dialogue and prompting the child to discuss their experiences and understandings. She concludes that this kind of communication may be less prevalent in the disadvantage group, leading to the disparities in utterance complexity.

Tough also emphasizes the importance of imaginative play on becoming reflective. She explains ==“the children in the disadvantaged groups used imagination as they played the roles of others and renamed objects, for example calling a stick a ‘gun.’ They did not, however, build up the imagined scene using language as the sole or major means of representation.==” (p177). This suggests that engaging in imaginative play within immersive scenes allows children to develop empathy, and become reflective earlier.

Tough concludes by asserting ==“the child is dependent on the skills of the teacher, and on the view that the teacher takes of him.==” (p179). Children are entirely dependent on their social environment to teach them how to be an effective human being, and my head spins with the impact of every action and variable on the development of the mind and self. This can extend past children though, as everything we do in the presence of others ‘teaches’ them what is normal and possible. Conversely, the way we react to and engage others teaches them what is acceptable, and can reinforce the social role they inhabit. Acting with intention and empathy are essential then to engage everyone around us to be more reflective and understanding as well. The ripple starts with you.
