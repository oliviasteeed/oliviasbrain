### Questions/Connections/Thoughts
- 
## Notes
- use what's helpful, let go of the rest
- creativity is a fundamental aspect of being human - making anything new
- creating our experience of reality (turning chaos into order) is the ultimate baseline creative act
- your entire life is a form of self expression, a singular work of art
- everything humans do is humanity being true to itself
- you are part of great unfolding greater than yourself, all transmuters for energies of the universe, if someone has same idea it's time for it to be expressed
- artists feel everything more deeply, finely tuned to sense signals, practice way of being like child with awe

- begin with everything
- resonant - familiar coming back in unfamiliar form
- the physical world has limits, the imagined world does now, the work exists in both

- awareness without attachment or involvement - what is happening in the eternal now
- as soon as you label you are not noticing but analyzing - live first, then understand
- universe only as large as awareness of it, increasing awareness increases universe

- the vessel - collection of experience
- source, filter, vessel, expression cycle
- the instrument is you

- spiritual, then art, then science

- when looking for solutions - pay close attention to what's happening around you, recieve messages by remaining open
- what are messages trying to tell us? 
- stay open to allow answers to arise within you - take in randomness and decipher what they're telling you
- look for what you notice but no one else sees

- widen scope - takes practice, not natural state
- three breaths every morning
- eat slow and mindfully
- feel blood through veins before sleep
- awareness needs constant refreshing - constant openness to receiving
- **real work of artist is way of being in the world**

- hunger for beauty, fascination and novelty
- immerse yourself in great works - calibrate meter for greatness

- nature is most absolute and enduring great work you can experience
- don't have to understand to be aware lf beauty - notice when breath takens away
- nature's palette and colours are infinite, reduces limits and categories

- you can't step into the same stream twice because it's always changing. everything is
- no one is the same person all day long

- there are always more options available to us than we realize
- the material exists within
- punch pillow for 5 minutes, then write down anything - the psyche is far deeper than conscious mind, access the subconscious dream state to bypass thinking/logic

- on overcast days the sun is still there
- this is your only chance to get this awareness
- source through nature/solitude, people, media - view currents within but not of
- there is no wrong way, there's only your way
- better to follow the universe than those around you
- art is not competitive, only you have your voice
- sensitivity/vulnerability to make art makes them more sensitive to judgment - desire to share must trump insecurity
- have no other choice - made whole through self expression
- blessed to create

- artists feel isolated, otherness, sensitivity - allows for great art but not replicatable

- to make more - don't see as The work just one more experiment to benefit the next one
- **creativity is free play with no rules - not playing to win, playing to play**
- some things too important to be taken seriously - oscar wilde
- desire to create must be bigger than fear

- gratitude to creation
- doubt your way to excellence
- the work is not about perfection - imperfections might be what makes the work great
- gold filled cracks - reframe struggles as guiding force of growth

- automatic action distraction allows creativity 

- nothing we do begins with us - everything we do is a collaboration
- never a direct translation from thought to work - the work is always an interpretation
- no interpretation is right or wrong, nobody can experience how you do
- purpose of work - awaken something in you, then awaken something in others

- making things too easy makes you less present during them and you enjoy it less
- without full experience and intention of work it is an empty shell
- every line is translation of artist's entire being
- work is intention not construction
- you don't have to know where you belong in the universe to contribute

- rules direct you to average behaviour, goal is to amplify differences, instead of sounding like others value and cherish your own voice
- **art is confrontation**
- you think a song is 3-5 minutes with repetition, to a bird it is totally different
- question all the standards and rules - narrowing possibilities before you even start
- every innovation risks becoming a rule, formulas are dangerous, challenge your own process - process is fluid 
- hold every rule as breakable

- every experiment is free throw - you have nothing to lose
- what is opposite?

- when listening there is only now
- ear is always present, cannot close
- formulating an opinion is not listening

- perform every action with attention you would give to landing an airplane
- impatience is an argument with reality
- insight is deliberate attention
- not taking norms and tradition into account frees ai to be creative
- [[Beginner's Mind]] - start from pure childlike place, assume we know nothing, the impossible becomes accessible when we do not know the limits - barricade of knowledge

- talent is ability to let ideas manifest through you

- inspiration is universal conversation we all yearn to be part of - inspira meaning to breathe in or blow into, need space to let in new (in all areas of life)
- inspiration is to breathe life into
- vary inputs to vary outputs 
- everything can cause astonishment if looked at from a less jaded perspective - submerge yourself
- commitment
- when flowing keep going - ride out inspiration, recognize transmission, stay with the offering - serious obligation of artist, get through a full imperfect version, do not let the spark fade
- inspiration, then you, then audience

- effective small habits compound to big change - learning to tie your shoes
- the way we do anything is the way we do everything
- live life in service of art
- discipline and freedom are partners, discipline is harmonious relationship with time
- schedule uninterrupted play
- do not be interrupted by false beliefs, laziness or lack of commitment

## Process
**Experimentation**
- collect **seeds** without vision/judgment of what will work
- accumulate ideas, then decide what to invest in
- **experimentation** - search for life in seeds
- "editing prematurely can close off roads leading to beautiful vistas we have never seen before"
- solutions are stumbled upon in experimentation - remain open to new and unknown, mystery
- allow seed to follow it's own path to the sun
- sometimes their time has not yet come, save for later
- begin with question
- **follow** your interest and heart
- **failure** is the information you need to get where you want to go
- **observe** your own life with detachment - the outcome is not the end
- sensory joy
- craft - lines have been drawn, direction - labour not thrill of experimentation
- art can only exist when you execute the work
- several makes healthy detachment
- remain open to doing whatever it takes to make the art as good as it can be
- artist goal is not to produce but to create the best possible work - timeless excellence, patience, do not become confined to deadlines
- art is reflection of inner and outer world at time of creation - keeping it too long makes it disconnected
- unless actively working on work in progress don't consume it, otherwise will become attached to it

**Craft**
- artists share what we are unable to see but somehow already know
- goal of art is not perfection but to share who we are and how we see the world
- the personal is the universal
- filter is what makes work different
- art is a mirror for others to see their hidden reflection
- point and pov are different, pov is what makes it, not point
- the point is already made through act of perception and expression, it's of no consequence if it's understood or appreciated
- impossible to know who you are without expressing it in some way

reigniting creativity
- small steps - one line a day
- change environment - in the dark
- change stakes
- invite an audience - more focused
- change context
- change surroundings
- write for someone else
- add visuals
- limit informatiom

**Completion** - finishing touches
- show it to someone else to broaden perspective - not about pleasing them but learning more about them and work
- tells you more about them than art when giving feedback
- once fixed we lose control - put off completion because we don't want to commit, fear of permanence
- letting go - it is not the only work you'll ever make, remember that each piece is only reflection of us in this moment, need to let it go so can move on to another project
- each project is opportunity to express what is coming through you
- when making art the audience comes last - do not censor, do not overthink
- the work will tell you it's time to move on

- when we share ideas they are abundant, when we hold back with scarcity mindset we stagnate and block the flow
- whatever we concentrate on, we get
- an album is only a diary entry of a moment in time, be free to close one chapter and continue to the next
- your new work isn't worse or better just different - just as you will be

- experimenter - dream, play, do not want to complete
- finisher - move quickly to end without much experimentation

- impose temporary rules to make problem solving more innovative by discarding obvious solutions, force you out of comfort zone
- of no consequence if good or bad - purpose is self discovery
- audience comes last - do not stay where they are comfortable

- great art - make it for no other purpose than making your version of the beautiful
- create art so we may inhabit it ourselves
- "i want to make the best thing i can make" - all you can focus on when making art, pure creative intent, bar set for whatever you do, raises vibration for your entire life
> "==success occurs in the privacy of the soul==" - when you're pleased and ready to let go
- success can only be within your control - you cannot be confined by external reaction
- make each new work like you have nothing to lose - you don't

- be ecstatic - sensory joy and the ecstatic is the compass, visceral, doesn't have to make sense, there to guide you

- competing causes low vibration, rise to match others you admire in mutual love

- everything we make has an essence - your job is to distill to get to close to its essence as possible, less is more, strip away excess
- perfection is not when there is nothing left to add, but when there's nothing left to take away
- the creator stops being the creator once they finish, then they become a viewer, nobody can even know what a work means

- tune out anything but pure creative intent - business, criticism, judgment, self aggrandisement - absorb these voices early in life
- pure and unattached 
- acknowledge self criticism, all that matters is that you are making best work you can here and now, let criticism pass
- viewing ourself from lens of others weakens connection with ourself
- self awareness is transcendence, abandonment of ego, think of work as bigger than you
>  "we're on a distant metaphysical journey from the here to the now"
- you have stream of generative creativity flowing through you at all times, just a matter of engaging with it or not - practice truly seeing what's there without negativity bias, don't throw it all away"
> "if you're open and stay attuned to what's happening the answers will be revealed"

- pay close attention, relaxing of effort - trying can get in the way, meditate
> "question isn't being worked on, just loosely held in awareness"

-  surrender conscious mind - ideas that want to come through will arise, you are unique channel to higher wisdom of universe accessible to all through grace
- living in discovery not assumption

- when we don't yet know where we're going, we don't wait, we venture into the dark
- believe in possibility that doesn't exist yet to bring it to fruition
- go so far you are inept - failure brings you closer to mastery
- faith in experimentation - the answer is out there

- actively stretch your point of view - sameness is dullness, broaden source
- heart of open mindedness is curiosity - craving constant expansion

- focus on areas before and after lightning 
- epiphanies are moments of seeing greater potential - you are broken open and reality is expansion
- dilligence in working to cultivate inspiration
> "do what you can with what you have. nothing more is needed."

- you are never done being an artist - work of doing and being
- commitment to staying open, curious, aware and present at all times - watching and waiting

> "every work contains a lifetime of experience"

- can only assess something in comparison to something else - make two options and follow option that hints at the ecstatic
> "turn off conscious mind, follow our impulses"

- there does not have to be a greater purpose
> "when we are making things we love our mission is accomplished, there is nothing at all to figure out"
- the work of art influences society indirectly, not through intention - creative work does not accomplish the goal by aiming for it
> "the artist's only responsibility is to the work itself"

- art requires an obsessive desire to create great things
> "the only practice that matters is the one we consistently do"

- the point of life is to contribute to the cycle of creation

-  ==you are no longer a student you have no right to be a professor==
- you can't do it yet - you have capacity to learn, learn more to reliably convey ideas but be careful to not become stuck in technical skill
> "to hone your craft is to honour your creation"

- listen as a whole, not to the checklist - every element is interdependent
- clean slate - step away
> "time is where learning occurs"

> =="context changes the content"==

- we catch excitement from the work, feels like the other unexplainable cosmic energy - love
> "the creator and the creation depend on each other to survive"
- the best work is the one you're excited about

- death and rebirth - physical body goes back to earth, mental self go back to source creativity for everyone to draw from
- art is play 
> "break free of the shackles of reality"

- constant negotiation between different selves - self is a prism, spectrum of feelings, thoughts, and associations - allow reality to bend uniquely through us, take on different selves to make different works

- if you disagree on which iteration you are not going far enough - working together to get past current iteration
- should not always see eye to eye or not eye to eye
- ==overlapping two different colour filters creates a new shade - welcome the friction==
- feedback - be as specific as possible about the work, do not offer solutions

> "art goes deeper than thought"
> "anything that allows the audience to access how you see the world is accurate, even if the information is wrong"

- editing is an expression of taste - step back and support work's full potential
- cut back drastically to expose the essential - what is completely necessary? not to desired length but to what must stay to keep it itself
- being an artist is constantly asking how can i make it better

- the act of self expression isn't really about you
> "art is a reverberation of an impermenant life"
- i was here
- art - there is no separation - we are one

- point of reference for beauty is nature - the universe holds sense of harmony
- everything in universe has a vibration - this is what creates tension and release
- excitement with deeper sense of calm is how you know it's working

- the magic is what we do not know
- when we frame ourself as an artist we comstrain ourself

- stories are not reality, they don't illuminate what is, they mislead us
- truth is diminished and possibilities and negated by stories - work of artist is to let go of stories and see as really is

- the universe never explains why
