## Notes
- technology as a practice

- [[Technology creates the era]] (p75)

- central process - most efficient/well-designed peripheral (but necessary) technologies are clunky (p84)
	- not sexy enough to put real intention or innovation into
	- also so pervasive/common changing anything is too much work

- thoughts emerge first, then we put them into words (p97)

- [[Intelligence as knowledge]]
- "genius" or "prodigy" just means someone with a lot of domain knowledge (p123)

- when society's basic needs are met a huge new array of "needs" emerge (p175)

- biology/technology lens convergence (p208)

- [[Abstraction is beauty]] porn
> "dreams of pure order" (p212)

- techne (Greek) - bringing forth of the true into the beautiful (p214)
