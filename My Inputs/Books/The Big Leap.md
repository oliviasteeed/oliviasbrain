## Summary
### Context
- A very cheesy but genuinely valuable self-help book from 2009 about letting yourself be happy and achieve your potential. One of my favourite musicians, Liz Nistico, said it changed her life and so I read it. Gay Hendricks is now my personal hero.
### Main Takeaways
- you have permission to be happy - simply allow yourself to be
- it's you that's blocking you from your zone of genius because the discomfort beyond your upper limit is scary (but worth it)
- ====“having a willingness to feel good and have life go well all the time is a genuinely radical act.”==
- fear is just excitement
### Questions/Connections/Thoughts
- how does gay hendricks live a perfect life?
## Notes
Hendricks explains his concept of the ‘Upper Limit,’ or the limit of well-being after which we self sabotage. He illustrates, ====“I have a limited tolerance for feeling good. When I hit my Upper Limit, I manufacture thoughts that make me feel bad. The problem is bigger than just my internal feelings, though: I seem to have a limited tolerance for my life going well in general. When I hit my Upper Limit, I do something that stops my forward trajectory. I get into a conflict with my ex-wife, get into a money bind, or do something else that brings me back down within the bounds of my limited tolerance.”== (p7).

====“In the face of so much evidence that life hurts and is fraught with adversity on all fronts, having a willingness to feel good and have life go well all the time is a genuinely radical act.”== (p11)

Hendricks explains the mental game of well-being, and refutes the insistence that doing well all the time is impossible. He states, ====“the only relevant question is whether you will let it be possible for you.”== (p15).

Hendricks suggests how to manage anxiety, ====“the best advice I can give is to take big, easy breaths when you feel fear. Feel the fear instead of pretending it’s not there. Celebrate it with a big breath, just the way you’d celebrate your birthday by taking a big breath and blowing out all the candles on your cake. Do that, and your fear turns into excitement. Do it more, and your excitement turns into exhilaration. I find it very empowering to know that I’m in charge of the exhilaration I feel as I go through life. I bet you will too.”== (p18). 

Hendricks differentiates life into four ‘zones,’ the Zone of Incompetence, or things we are not good at, the Zone of Competence, or things we are okay at, the Zone of Excellence, or where we comfortably do well, and the Zone of Genius where we are pushing ourselves to achieve our full potential. (p29-36). 

====“You know deep inside you that you will never be fully satisfied until you have anchored yourself in your Zone of Genius. To do less would be to hold back, and long ago you made a handshake deal with the universe that you wouldn’t do that. The seductive comforts of success, though, can lull us into accepting the status quo. In that state of comfort, it’s easy to forget the deal you made with the universe to use yourself fully.”== (p28). We owe it to the universe to actualize.

Hendricks suggests how to deal with relationship issues, ====“when the big stuff comes up, ask your partner if she or he is willing to join you as an equal partner on a learning journey. If the answer is yes, you join together in a relationship of true possibility.”== (p43). 

Hendricks explains one of the four factors holding people back from their ‘Zone of Genius’ is feeling fundamentally flawed and unworthy. He suggests, ======“the fear of being fundamentally flawed brings with it a related fear. It’s the fear that if you did make a full commitment to living in your Zone of Genius, you might fail. It’s the belief that even your genius is flawed, and that if you expressed it in a big way, it wouldn’t be good enough. The belief tells you to play it safe and stay small. That way, if you fail, at least you fail small.”==== (p48). 

====“Behind every communication problem is a sweaty ten-minute conversation you don’t want to have.”== (p52). 

Hendricks explains another factor preventing people from surpassing the ‘Upper Limit,’ the fear of outshining others. He elaborates, ====“the other solution is to continue to shine brightly but turn down the volume on their enjoyment of it. If they can appear to be suffering, they can get empathy and sympathy from others instead of jealousy.”== (p56). This is I guess how I am in university? It feels so embarrassing and shameful to do well and enjoy it. Why is it disdainful to be happy?

Hendricks explains how to release anxieties, by asking the questions ====“is it a real possibility?”==, and ====“is there any action I can take right now to make a positive difference?”== (p65-66). If the answer to either is no, simply dismiss it. Hendricks asserts, ====“almost none of your worry-thoughts have anything to do with reality.”== (p63). 

====“When things are going well, or when you’re feeling particularly good, you can always bring yourself down by manufacturing a stream of worry-thoughts. Once you’ve brought yourself down by worrying, it’s very tempting to inflict those worry-thoughts on others. If we’re in the grip of worrying while someone around us isn’t, we seem to have an almost uncontrollable urge to criticize that person until he or she jumps into the stream of negativity with us.”== (p66).

====“[Go] cold turkey with criticism and blame.”== (p68).

====“A lot of people don’t realize that they can dismiss worry-thoughts just like that… You release the grip, and the thoughts disappear. They come back again, and you release them again. With practice, they disappear and don’t come back.”== (p74). I love the mindset of endless mental potential where any problem can be solved by a mindset shift. We create our reality so it’s not wrong.

====“Become a keen observer of critical statements that come out of your mouth or fly through your mind. Begin to sort them into two piles: Pile One contains all the criticisms about real things you plan to do something about; Pile Two contains all the others. I predict you’ll make the humbling but liberating discovery, as I did, that Pile Two towers over the paltry stack in Pile One.”== (p79-80).

On taking compliments, ====“pause for a moment to register the beam of positive energy that’s being aimed at you. Then thank the person who beamed it your way.”== (p83). It’s that easy.

====“When I maintain an attitude of cheerful wonder and keen interest toward my faults and flaws, I see them dissolve and transform much more rapidly than when I give myself a hard time about them.”== (p110). No energy wasted on complaining and ruminating, it’s all openness and opportunities.

Hendricks lists the most common behaviours used to bring people down when they reach their upper limit: ====“worrying, blame and criticism, getting sick or hurt, squabbling, hiding significant feelings, not keeping agreements, not speaking significant truths to the relevant people.”== (p111).

====“I commit to living in my Zone of Genius, now and forever.”== (p121). Just do it.

Hendricks advises repeating a mantra, his suggestion of the ‘ultimate success mantra’ is, ====“I expand in abundance, success, and love every day, as I inspire those around me to do the same.”== (p145). My versions are ‘I have permission to be happy’ and ‘I radiate abundance.’

Hendricks explains a critical tool for reaching the ‘Zone of Genius,’ the ‘Enlightened No.’ He elaborates, ====“you produce an Enlightened No when you turn down something that doesn’t fit into your Zone of Genius… You’re saying no in the service of your genius.”== (p152).

Hendricks asserts ====“you’ve got to pay exquisite attention”== (p156) to live in the Zone of Genius.

Hendricks suggests living in ‘Einstein time’ where ====“you’re where time comes from.”== (p160). What he means is what you are engaged in and your mental state changes the perception of time, so use this to your advantage. If you want time to go slow, make yourself bored, if you want time to go fast, keep yourself busy. He writes to look in the mirror and say ====“I acknowledge that I’m the source of time.”== or ====“I’m where time comes from”== to remind yourself. To start living this way, begin ====“complete abstinence from complaining about time”== (p179), because it is under your control. This part of the book is the most ‘out there,’ but I think the point is to stop feeling like a slave to time, develop an awareness of time and engage in activities you prioritize and understand that feeling rushed doesn’t make time move slower, so why waste life stressed for no reason?

====“Advertising encourages us to want a lot of things we don’t really need. It also encourages us to want to do a lot of things we don’t really want to do. All these problems disappear on Einstein Time”== (p172). Prioritize what you value.

====“We are all amateurs when it comes to feeling and expressing love.”== (p195). 

====“To prevent humiliating collisions with the universe, I suggest we all adopt an attitude of being open to learning in every moment of our relationships.”== (p195). This is beautiful.
