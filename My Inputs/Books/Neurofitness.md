## Summary
### Context
- 
### Main Takeaways
- 
### Questions/Connections/Thoughts
- 
## Notes
- Prefrontal Cortex is 1/5 inch covering on brain
- brain is floating and also liquid
- folded to fit into skull
- white matter: branches connecting neurons
- grey matter: neurons (cortex)
- axons and dendrites don't touch - synapse in between where neurotransmitters go between
#### brain anatomy
- frontal lobe - motivation and control
- parietal lobe - sensation (stimulating makes body parts feel things)
- occipital lobe - vision
- temporal lobe - hearing/processing - stimulating can make you hear kendrik lamar

- thalamusÂ  - relay
- hippocampus - memory
- amygdala - emotions
- brain stem - breathing
- cerebellum - coordination
- spinal cord - reflexes
#### brain optimization
- animals engage in [[Area Restricted Search]] - by location/category, think of more when you can think of more categories
- plants can learn a conditioned response - fan and light, grow towards fan

- brain HQ brain training can reduce dementia risk

- best way to memorize is [[Self Testing and Reinterpreting]]
- creativity is from both frontal lobes working together with brain coordinated by cerebellum - spark not from one point but all points
- [[Working memory + creativity are ingredients to productivity]]
- creativity and traits are on loan - gone if brain changes
- consider things and learn right before sleep - hypnogogic and hypnopompic states allow you to be creative with overlapping alpha and theta waves - basically from letting mind wander
- to be creative do anything but work - sleep, mind wander, walk in nature
- psychedelics disassemble freeways temporarily to create new connections between roads

- mind diet - plants, chicken, fish, whole grains are mainstay, anything else an indulgence
- try to be ambidextrous to increase brain connections
- neuroplasticity - different brain regions adapt
- use grid cells to navigate (lost in alzheimers)

- Deep Brain Stimulation - you can implant an electrode into the brain and stimulate areas to change mood, intelligence, memory - could treat memory impairments
- neural prosthetics to fix paralysis to translate signals, can implant electrodes and feel prosthetic
- mindfulness - network reset with mindful breathing to reset vagal tone

- phone presence makes you less attentive to environment - always half attuned to it
#### how to parent
- safety
- let them explore
- odds of developing mental disorders twice as high for people born and raised in cities - increased stressÂ 
- sleep very important - at least 7 hours
- free time/balance - boredom is enriching
- keep em close
#### aging
- adults over 40 brain shrinks 5% per decade
- why does memory weaken with age?
	- less neurotransmitters (dopamine - movement and reward)
	- poor sensory inputs - brain has to struggle to process
	- hemispheric atmospheric reduction - brain halves start to both activate for tasks because needs as much processing power as possible
	- hormone levels drop with age - change brain
- older adults have greater wellbeing - physical/cognitive health go down, happiness goes up
- super agers have strong social networksÂ 
- "wisdom is the inevitable final subject"
  #### lifestyle
- high blood sugar - poor aging
- resistance training with weights best for cognitive ability
