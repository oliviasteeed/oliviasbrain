## Notes
- controversial reaction to using nude photography as art reference
> "A general complaint was that 'woman' â€“ the generalized, idealized being â€“Â was a purely artistic creation, and that the woman revealed by photography was specific, identifiable and flawed." (p22) 

- changing view of body photography postwar
> "Edward Steichen, for example, prewar Impressionist par excellence, moved in his treatment of the nude to a bold new modernist style which dispensed with Pictoralist effects and began to see the body in an essentially sculptural fashion, as if flesh were just one of the new materials of the age, like concrete, glass and steel." (p27)

- photography as another art form, not objectivity
> "Taking his (Alfred Stieglitz) cue from Picasso's and Kandinsky's theories of painting, he understood that photography was not merely an objective record of a physical reality but a mirror, or equivalent, of the imagemaker's own emotional state." (p27)

- nude photography as opposing societal beliefs
> "She (Dianora Niccolini with her black male nudes), too, hoped to oppose the deeply rooted belief that the naked body was 'evil, dirty and therefore must be hidden â€“Â especially the male body." (p69)

- being controversial on purpose in hopes of making a point with the body
> "Such darker themes characterize much late twentieth-century photography of the naked figure. This is partly in relation to what are perceived as particularly troubled times for the body, and partly because nudity has become such a commonplace motif in popular culture and so ubiquitous in advertising that serious photographers believe some shock therapy is needed in order to reclaim the body for art." (p71)

- photography making a new, false reality
	- connects to [[How to Change Your Mind]] concept of seeing only cues to what we recognize, not the actual reality
> "Vallhonrat believes that this universal use, or rather abuse, of photography has cheated human beings of the ability to perceive and experience space in depth; increasingly we dwell in a flatted, two-dimensional image world." (p72-75)

- focus on the person, not just flesh in nude photography
 > "Their work should remind us that the purely physical dimension of flesh is only one thread in the body's fabric." (p155)

- before photography, seeing extremely muscular/athletic people wasn't common. once photos were easy to distribute, photos of muscular and athletic people were popular as curiosities.
> "Photographs of gymnasts and circus performers were particularly popular. People relished the fast that they were seeing real people, rather than the idealized representations familiar from prints, because it suggested that the well-developed body was within their own reach." (p168)

- sports photography could only become popular once cameras had fast enough shutter speed. sport photographer also has to be sport specialist familiar with game.
> "The postwar breed of specialist was required to know his sport as well as his craft in order to pinpoint the critical moment of a race of fight." (p170)

- curiosity at violence and destruction of humans
> "Mankind which in Homer's time was an object of contemplation for the Olympic gods, now is one for itself. Its self-alienation has reached such a degree that it can experience its own destruction as an aesthetic pleasure of the first order." -Walter Benjamin (p238)

> "ultimately each person has to confront his or her own corporeal reality." (p238)

- photo albums bring mortality and inevitability of time passing to mind more than we used to think of these
> "After a while we shall grow accustomed to the hard truths the camera teaches us, but the present generation is the first to appreciate them to the full. That life is but a span is illustrated in every family album in the kingdom, and the adage was never so vividly and frequently brought home to us as in these days of photography." (p240)

- photography impacts on self concept
	- reminds me of [[Peace of Mind]] concept - no peace or happiness without body/mind connection
> "Photography brought with it a new awareness of self image, but at a cost â€“ the separation of the self from the body. This is reflected in accounts of people preparing themselves for encounters with the camera." (p241)

> "Today the cult of perfection often leads to obsession and neurosis." (p272)
- [[Photography created vision of "normal"]]

- portraiture no longer was for representing the self truthfully, but the ideal self
	- social media
> "The portrait functioned therefore as a kind of surrogate or ambassador for the self. In this sense it was more than a commemorative mark; it represented an extension of personal power â€“ the power to influence the judgement and behaviour of others." (p274)

- societal impacts of photographs of the beautiful
> "The enormous demand for photographs of beautiful women for various promotional schemes had the effect of creating a new kind of celebrity, one who was famous not for any particular talent or social attribute, but merely for being photogenic. The Photographic News called her a 'professional beauty', complaining that 'photography and society journals must share between them the onus of having invented such a purposeless creature.'" (p282)
