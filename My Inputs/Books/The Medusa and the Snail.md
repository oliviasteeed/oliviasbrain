## Summary
### Context
- Published in 1979, this is a beautifully written collection of poetic essays on personhood, nature and the development of society by physician, educator, researcher, etymologist and poet Lewis Thomas. In it he brings a biological perspective to the issues of modern society, as well as examining the roots and development of the words, customs and beliefs we take for granted today. It helped me realize I do not know enough about the wonders of the natural world.
### Main Takeaways
-  Everyone is an individual, therefore exactly the same.
### Questions/Connections/Thoughts
- 
## Notes

==“We tend to think of ourselves as the only wholly unique creatures in nature, but it is not so. Uniqueness is so commonplace a property of living things that there is really nothing unique about it.==” (p2). Everyone is an individual and therefore exactly like everyone else.

Thomas explains that different kinds of sensing mechanisms and markers allow organisms to differentiate between ‘me’ and ‘other.’ It is these that enable us to reject and repel the other, and conversely retain and protect the self. Sometimes these mechanisms get mixed up and two organisms merge into one, as they do not know better to reject each other. (p2) Is this what falling in love is like?
  
When recounting a trip to the zoo in which Thomas experienced childlike joy while watching beavers and otters, he explains that ignorance was a prequisite for wonder. ==“I became a behavioural scientist, an experimental psychologist, an ethologist, and in the instant I lost all the wonder and the sense of being overwhelmed. I was flattened.==” (p7) The innate need to impose structure on experience robs it of its mysticism and joy.

==“Altruism, a jargon word for what used to be called love.==” (p8)

Thomas notes how seeking life in space requires a level of novel thought probably impossible to humans. Perhaps there is life on Mars in some crevice or ravine, entirely isolated, but we are so caught up in our own conceptions of what ‘life’ is that we’ve missed it entirely. ==“It is beyond our imagination to conceive of a single form of life that exists alone and independent, unattached to other forms.==” (p11). I’ve often thought of this when reminded of extraterrestrial life, or even how humans judge planets as ‘habitable’ or not. Why do we think other life forms would need what we need to survive? Just as we seem perfectly adapted to our environment, would other life not be perfectly adapted to planets composed of toxic (to us) gas or even the vacuum of space. For all we know the universe is crawling with other life forms, but we just can’t recognize them as life, and maybe they can’t recognize us either, and maybe we can keep cohabitating like that for eternity.

While comparing the hypothetical ravine-dwelling residents of Mars, Thomas explains that such a way of life is unfathomable because every life form on Earth is connected and ==“everything here is alive thanks to the living of everything else.==” (p12). He speaks from a mainly biological perspective as a medical doctor, but socially this is also very true (I guess drawing a line between biological and social forces is kind of fruitless). I often feel like the world is a cold, uninhabitable void warmed only by the presence of people I love.

Thomas describes humans as ==“perhaps uniquely among the Earth’s creatures, the worrying animal==” (p14), and yet this is what has led to our success as a species, because we can’t just sit still and accept things as they are. We are always trying to change them, to categorize, to control. It’s interesting reading this in a book published in 1980, which seems like a long time ago, and yet nothing has really changed. I guess humans just perpetually thing their capacity to worry is a new issue that means something is wrong with them or society or probably both.

In a discussion of DNA, or nature’s greatest marvel, Thomas says ==“given enough time, we would have figured out how to do this, nucleotides, enzymes, and all, to make flawless, exact copies, but it never would have occurred to us, thinking as we do, that the thing had to be able to make errors. The capacity to blunder is the real marvel of DNA. Without this special attribute, we would still be anaerobic bacteria and there would be no music.==” (p23). This is such a poetic way to underline how perfectionism annihilates progress.

A couple chapters later, Thomas contradicts himself by saying ==“mistakes are at the very base of human thought, embedded there, feeding the structure like root nodules. If we were not provided with the knack of being wrong, we could never get anything useful done.==” (p30). He describes how the aftermath of the accident is when the breakthrough happens because it releases us from the script and we actually have to think on our feet for once. Mistakes often get blamed on ‘human error’ (which by the way isn’t real, it’s always the design’s fault), so we concern ourselves with becoming more precise and avoid errors at all costs. Is that actually a route to greater ‘success’ though? Fallibility is built into us because it allows us to create new paths that might be better. Maybe all the perfect humans went extinct because they never did anything new. Thomas ends the chapter saying that instead of using machines to achieve perfection, we should harness their processing capacity to compute more mistakes than we could ever make. ==“Think of what could be gained from the near infinity of precise, machine-made miscomputation which is now so easily within our grasp.==” (p32). Is this a proactive defense of AI hallucinations? How can we reframe the mistakes AI makes into opportunities? 

==“We are at our human finest, dancing with our minds, when there are more choices than two. Sometimes there are ten, even twenty different ways to go, all but one bound to be wrong, and the richness of selection in such situations can lift us onto totally new ground. This process is called exploration and is based on human fallibility.==” (p31). This serves as a beautiful description of the design process.

In a discussion of psychiatric patients claiming to have multiple personalities Thomas writes ==“I am not sure that the number of different selves is pathological; I hope not. Eight strikes me personally as a reasonably small and easily manageable number. It is the simultaneity of their appearance that is the real problem, and I should think psychiatry would do better by simply persuading them to queue up and wait their turn, as happens with the normal rest of us.==” (p33). The way Thomas writes about ‘the self’ is so relatable, as I have a tenuous grasp of myself at best. I can’t keep up with myself and the way what I want and who I am seems to change daily. It’s reassuring to read that somebody else feels the same way, that maybe everyone feels this way. Why doesn’t anyone talk about how disorienting self-development is? He goes on to explain ==“the only thing close to what you might call illness, in my experience, is was in the gaps in the queue when one had finished and left the place before the next one was ready to start, and there was nobody around at all.==” (p34). This is how I’ve felt for years.

In a chapter about health care Thomas notes the growing attitude that humans are essentially on the verge of falling apart at all times and need constant tending. He notes that ==“as a people, we have become obsessed with Health. There is something fundamentally, radically unhealthy about all this.==” (p37), or more succinctly stated, ==“vitamins have taken the place of prayer.==” (p37). The health obsession is evermore pervasive now everywhere you look because us humans are terrified of death. We like to feel in control and what better way to evade death than wasting all your money on products that promise you more life? The irony is we waste our lives working to buy them, and most of the health claims are just marketing terms with no basis in reality. Ignorance is bliss baby.

==“We should be worrying that our preoccupation with personal health may be a symptom of copping out, an excuse for running upstairs to recline on the couch, sniffing the air for contaminants, spraying the room with deodorants, while just outside, the whole of society is coming undone.==” (p40).  

In a discussion of the impossibility of creating a true clone of someone due to the unreplicable environmental impacts on human development, Thomas notes ==“indeed, if all you had was the genome, and no people around, you’d grow a sort of vertebrate plant, nothing more.==” (p43). This is how I feel about generative AI when considering if it could have some form of ‘consciousness.’ I think experience is a requisite of consciousness (isn’t it basically what consciousness is?). Yes it receives a lot of data, but it doesn’t exist anywhere, or experience the data in the way humans do. I can also ‘receive data;’ sitting in my room I can read about being social (or a more maladaptive example, watch YouTube videos) to provide a surrogate social experience, but it’s completely different than the real thing. In isolation I am not really living, and neither is AI.

==“Fiddle around, if you must fiddle, but never with ways to keep things the same, no matter who, not even yourself.==” (p45). Allowing things to change is a virtue.

The word for poison developed from the latin word poi (to drink), and ==“the venomous meaning did not come until the notion of love potions evolved, and the idea of poison came to consciousness.==” (p48). Love really is a poison, it destroys everything you have and leaves you an addict for one thing only.

==“Are there some kinds of information leading to some sorts of knowledge that human beings are really better off not having? Is there a limit to scientific inquiry not set by what is knowable but by what ought to be knowing?==” (p53). I vote yes, but who gets to decide this? And how? Before something is known how is one to know to prohibit its exploration, and once it is discovered it’s too late.

==“Worrying is the most natural and spontaneous of all human functions.==” (p67). It’s reassuring to read this and realize that humans never change and the mood issues we face now are just a part of us.

Thomas writes about the human endeavor to override and dominate nature and the synthetic environments we now spend most of our lives in. He questions ==“we will have everything under control, managed. Then what will we do? On long Sunday afternoons, what do we do, when there is nobody to talk to but ourselves?==” (p89). Once we have destroyed everything else in the pursuit of control, power and money what will we have left to distract ourselves? Only the possibility is enjoyable, but goals, once reached, are hollow and meaningless. Reality can never live up to expectations.

In one chapter, Thomas has a lengthy discussion of his liking for French philosopher Michel de Montaigne, and his thoughts on the self. Thomas cites Montaigne ==“I have seen no more evident monstrosity and miracle in the world than myself… The more I frequent myself and know myself, the more my deformation astonishes me, and the less I understand myself.==” (p120). Later he cites again ==“There is as much difference between us and ourselves as there is between us and others.==” (p123). The idea of ‘the self’ as a constant, driving force is a myth. The self is made of overlapping parts, reshuffling constantly, and so is everyone else. If only we could find enough overlap in our depths to tolerate and befriend everyone.

In the final chapter, Thomas claims ==“I can think of one thing that is wrong with us and eats away at us: we do not know enough about ourselves.==” (p145), which is an appropriate way to end the book. Both in a personal, psychological sense, but also in a biological, environmental and anthropological sense, we do not know enough. The more I learn about human history the more I realize nothing changes, and the norms we live by are wholly arbitrary. Yes, there is value in self-reflection and ‘getting to know the self,’ but I think a pursuit of equal, or potentially greater value is learning more about us as humans. It’s an excellent catalyst for reflection and understanding of the self and others if nothing else.
