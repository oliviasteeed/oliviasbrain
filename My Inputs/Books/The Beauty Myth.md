## Notes
## Introduction: The Beauty Myth
- porn a replacement for natural sexuality
> "it is almost impossible for younger women to distinguish the role pornography plays in creating their idea of how to be, look, and move in sex from their own innate sense of sexual identity." (p5)

- both genders are becoming increasingly concerned about beauty and sex
> "Is it progress when both genders can be commodified and evaluated as objects? Only of the most double-edged kind." (p8)

- relationship between female liberation and female beauty - cannot be ignored
> "they can no longer restrict to the subconscious their sense that this lack of freedom has something to do withâ€“with apparently frivolous issues, things that really should not matter. Many are ashamed to admit that such trivial concernsâ€“to do with physical appearance, bodies, faces, clothesâ€“matter so much. But in spite of shame, guilt, and denial, more and more women are wondering if it isn't that they are entirely neurotic and alone but rather that something important is indeed at stake that has to do with the relationship between female liberation and female beauty." (p9)

- beauty standards increase as female liberation does to counteract it with soft power structure
> "The more legal and material hindrances women have broken through, the more strictly and heavily and cruelly images of female beauty have come to weigh upon us." (p10)
> "We are in the midst of a violent backlash against feminism that uses images of female beauty as a political weapon against women's advancement: the beauty myth." (p10)
> "The contemporary backlash is so violent because the ideology of beauty is the last one remaining of the old feminine ideologies that still has power to control those women whom second wave feminism would have otherwise made relatively uncontrollable." (p10)
- beauty is control

- as soon as labour laws protected women for their gender, discriminating based on appearance because institutionalized. Broke feminine mystique promoted by household products only to be replaced by diet and skin care industries.
> "Feminists... broke the stranglehold on the women's popular press of advertisers for household products, who were promoting the feminine mystique; at once, the diet and skin care industries became the new cultural censors of women's intellectual space, and because of their presence, the gaunt, youthful model supplanted the happy housewife as the arbiter of successful womanhood." (p11)
- after this, sexual liberation was followed by the proliferation of beauty pornography where beauty is equated with sexualityâ€“another way to control women's bodies, this time with their sense of sexuality and self esteem.

- beauty the new oppression - softer but more pervasive/harder to resist
> "Inexhaustible but ephemeral beauty took over from inexhaustible but ephemeral housework. As the economy, law, religion, sexual mores, education, and culture were forcibly opened up to include women more fairly, a private reality colonized female consciousness. By using ideals about "beauty," it reconstructed an alternative female world with its own laws, economy, religion, sexuality, education, and culture, each element as repressive as any that had gone before." (p16)

> "The Stereotype: to her belongs all that is beautiful, even the very word beauty itself... she is a doll... I'm sick of this masquerade." (p12) -Germaine Greer

- beauty myth controls behaviour through lens of beauty
- divides women across generations and devalues those with power and wisdom
- predicates self esteem on outside approval - keeping women powerless
> "The beauty myth is always actually prescribing behaviour and not appearance. Competition between women has been made part of the myth so that women will be divided from one another. Youth and (until recently) virginity have been "beautiful" in women since they stand for experiential and sexual ignorance. Aging in women is "unbeautiful" since women grow more powerful with time, and since the links between generations of women must always be newly broken: Older women fear young ones, young women fear old, and the beauty myth truncates for all the female life span. Most urgently, women's identity must be premised upon our "beauty" so that we will remain vulnerable to outside approval, carrying the vital sensitive organ of self-esteem exposed to the air." (p14)

- beauty norms are new - came from proliferation of photography - [[Photography created vision of "normal"]]
> "Most of our assumptions about the way women have always thought about "beauty" date from no earlier than the 1830s, when the cult of domesticity was first consolidated and the beauty index invented. For the first time new technologies could reproduceâ€“in fashion plates, daguerrotypes, tintypes, and rotogravuresâ€“images of how women should look." (p15)

- beauty myth used to justify sex differences and female fragility/uselessnessâ€“the feminine sphere to enclose women within (p15)
- women's work as repetitive, time-consuming and painful tasks (needlepoint, lacemaking) to keep women's energy occupied (p15)

- economy depends on underpayment of women, and female spending on beauty industry
- oppression of women has been essential to development of industrialized society
> "Behaviour that is essential for economic reasons is transformed into social virtue. As soon as a woman's primary social value could no longer be defined as the attainment of virtuous domesticity, the beauty myth redefined it as the attainment of virtuous beauty." (p18)

- stereotype of unfeminine feminists interrupts identity and self esteem of women - "became paradigm for new limits placed on aspiring women everywhere." (p19)

> "After the success of the women's movement's second wave, the beauty myth was perfected to chackmate power at every level in individual women's lives. The modern neuroses of life in the female body spread from woman to woman at epidemic rates." (p19)

## Work
- beauty as wealth, success and value in the professional world
> "By the time the women's movement had made inroads into the labour market, both women and men were accustomed to having beauty evaluated as wealth. Both were prepared for the striking development that followed: As women demanded access to power, the power structure used the beauty myth materially to undermine women's advancement." (p20)

- labour inequality
> "While women represent 50 percent of the world population, they perform nearly two-thirds of all working hours, receive only one-tenth of the world income and own less than 1 percent of world property." (p23)

- best qualities for women in labour pool are to be sedate, brainless, repetitive task machines without ambition or self-respect. 
> women described as "literate and docile labour pool, and therefore desirable candidates for the information and people-processing jobs thrown up by modern service industries. The qualities that best serve employers in such labor pool's workers are: low self-esteem, a tolerance for dull, repetitive tasks, lack of ambition, high conformity, more respect for men (who manage them) than women (who work beside them), and little sense of control over their lives." (26)
- difference between this and modern labour pool? is this not what industrialized society wants from most? ambition and self-esteem mean standing up for what you deserve and potentially leaving instead of being owned by a specific company.

- as women get more powerful, standard and value on the beautiful, display professionals (actor, sex worker, model) is ever higher
> "The stronger that women grow, the more prestige, fame, and money is accorded to the display professions: They are held higher and higher above the heads of rising women, for them to emulate." (p27)

- you can never be too beautiful - infinite source of control and insecurity
> "The closer women come to power, the more physical self-consciousness and sacrifice are asked of them. "Beauty" becomes the condition for a woman to take the next step. You are now too rich. Therefore, you cannot be too thin." (p28)

- women's magazines take advantage of meritocracy language to keep women consuming in hopes of obtaining status, also reinforce total personal responsibility for body to point of shaming for not controlling it into standards
> "they keep women consumer their advertisers' products in pursuit of total personal transformation in status that the consumer society offers men in the form of money." (p29)
- beauty is female version of commodified value

- men achieve status by money, women by beauty - both reduce a person to abstracted material quality without tangible benefits (extrinsic rewards - taught)
> "Since both value systems are reductive, neither reward is ever enough, and each quickly loses any relationship to real-life values. Throughout the decade, as money's ability to buy time for comfort and leisure was abandoned in the stratospheric pursuit of wealth for wealth's sake, the competition for "beauty" saw a parallel inflation: The material pleasures once presented as its goalsâ€“sex, love, intimacy, self-expressionâ€“were lost in a desperate struggle within a sealed economy, becoming distant and quaint memories." (p30)

- using sexiness to undercut seriousness of women in professional spaces (p31)
> "five studies have found that a woman's behaviour... is noticed and labeled sexual even if it is not intended as such." (p43)

- beauty is generic standard for women - makes them valued for generic attributes and not individual strengths or values
> "What is generic is replaceable. With youth and beauty, then, the working woman is visible, but insecure, made to feel her qualities are not unique. But, without them, she is invisibleâ€“she falls, literally, "out of the picture."" (p34)

- women are obsessed with appearance because it is most direct way to control how the world treats them
> "The area of appearance seems to be one where women feel they can most easily exert some control over how they will be responded to." (p43)

- women paid and valued less and the market depends on this
> "The myth is political and not sexual: Money does the work of history more efficiently than sex. Low female self-esteem may have a sexual value to some individual men, but it has a financial value to all of society. Women's poor physical self-image is far less a result of sexual competition than of the needs of the marketplace." (p49)

- women are expected to 'invest' in beauty to succeed in the professional world - spend around a quarter of income on beauty products seen as necessary to get ahead meaning even when women do get ahead they amass less wealth over time
> ""Women are punished  for their looks, whereas men can go far in just a grey flannel suit," complains, ironically, a former beauty editor of Vogue, who estimates that her maintenance expenses will be $8,000 annually. Urban professional women are devoting up to a third of their income to "beauty maintenance," and considering it a necessary investment.
> "The few women who are finally earning as much as men are forced, through the PBQ, to pay themselves significantly less than their male peers take home. It has engineered do-it-yourself income discrimination." (p52-53).

- work keeps you exhausted so you cannot step out of line - man or woman - creates nostalgia for the feminine mystique days of domesticity
> "Already in the United States, there are murmurs among worn-out career women of nostalgia for life before the mechanized stairs that lead nowhere. All labour systems that depend on coercing a work force into accepting bad conditions and unfair compensation have recognized the effectiveness of keeping that work force exhausted to keep it from making trouble." (p54)
- how do I get out of this

## Culture
- men do not obsess over male models as much as women are influenced by female models - why is identity so externally constructed?
> "Why do women react to the "ideal," whatever form she takes at that moment, as if she were a non-negotiable commandment?"
