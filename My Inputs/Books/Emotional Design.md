## Summary
### Context
- book by father of human-centred design and god of usability Don Norman about our relationships and emotional reactions to industrially designed objects
### Main Takeaways
- responsibility of design to cater to all levels of processing to make people feel happy when using products - if you have the potential to improve people's lives you have the obligation to at least try
- it's the small things that wear you down or lift you up
### Questions/Connections/Thoughts
- 
## Notes
- [[Happiness facilitates creativity]] (p19)

- attachment is not to things but to the relationship they represent (p48)
	- like [[The Dialectics of Shopping]] - gift represents a role someone plays more than object itself
	- like [[The Meaning of Things]] - most cherished objects are some way to remember history or transcend the self

- [[Levels of processing]] (from most to least control)
	- reflective (top-down/high level)
	- behavioural (motor response)
	- visceral (bottom up, uncontrollable gut feeling)

- affordance - what the product allows you to do
- signifier - tells you what affordance the product has

- people want to buy and own beautiful things
> "The design becomes the product" (p64)

> "Today's sophistication runs the risk of being tomorrows discard" (p67)

> "Learn once, remember forever" (p75)

- [[You create your reality]] - [[Taking 100% responsibility is the first step to improving]]
- errors are bad design (p78)

- artists surveyed people on their art preferences and made "user-centred art" that was disturbing and everyone hated it. Innovation and artistry are required for things to be appealing. We want a bit of surprise. (p98)

- [[Flow]] - aware only of activity and enjoyment of it (p125)

- humans anthropomorphize/project human emotions and beliefs onto anything they can (p138)

- Positive emotions keep us driven, curious and able to act. Pure reason is paralyzing. (p166)
