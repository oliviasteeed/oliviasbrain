## Notes
- humans and all are artifacts are socially constructed. facts can be "true" and socially constructed (p3)

- [[Abstraction is beauty]]
- things are labeled "pure" when they are stripped of their social origins through abstraction (p8)
	- this also means losing the depth of concepts and contextual understanding. makes it less "true" because nothing exists in isolation?

- the [[Myth of objectivity]]
- science is not objective because the human mediator between world and thought/perception are not objective (p24)

- [[Technological fix]] - belief that any problem can be solved with technology
- [[Technological determinism]] - progress is defined by new technology which is always positive

- [[Technology is abstraction]]
- technology abstracts our connections to production, community, and interests of society (p75)

- in industrial revolution machines made to enforce power and order became the basis for a new religion (p76)

- technology is not neutral - what does it afford and what does it mean? (p85)
- tools are a means of power dynamics because they afford certain actions only (p90)

> "(technology) fills our time and governs our movements" (p88)

- we are already cyborgs (p90) - Donna Harraway Cyborg Manifesto

- science as means to simplify complexity and feel in control
- science violently imposes order on society (p96)
