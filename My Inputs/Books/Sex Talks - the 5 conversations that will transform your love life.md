## Summary
### Context
- psychoanalyst vanessa
### Main Takeaways
- different sex drives - responsive and sponteneous
### Questions/Connections/Thoughts
- 
## Notes
- loss of spark is actually loss of communication
- sex is anything you do with your body that brings you pleasure

## Part 1: All about you
- the fucking fairytale is a myth - relationships, love and sex are not effortless like they are in media
- 1-3 years of cocaine/OCD lust, after that your brain cannot maintain it
- stress is number one sex drive killer - cortisol shuts down all unneccessaryth functions
- "should" is sign of perfectionism
> "what we resists persists"
- make list of expectations, then take objective look and ask if they are resonable
- true intimacy is communication, ability to talk about anything
- figure out yourself first - what turns you on, what do you enjoy?
- you already know what you want
- identify turn offs first, then turn ons
- two sex drive types - mental desire (sex sounds good) and physical arousal - happen separately
- spontaneous - mental, then physical - feel desire before body responds, turned on in a lot of situations (men)
- responsive - physical, then mental - not interested until physically engaged, rarey initiate, don't think about it (women)
- come as you are book
- anticipating great sex will make it better
- think about early fantasies

First understand your sex boundaries - use red, yellow and green light system - have boundaries but analyze where they came from
- don't sound sexy
- don't sound safe
- go against values

red lights
- safety or value based reason?
- why do i have this boundary?
- is it serving me to say no?
- do i want to keep this boundary?

- nonconcordance - mind and body are not in line
- *being a psychologist is telling stories to convey concepts*
- write down "there's a part of me that believes" statements - you are not your blockages, analyze where it originated
- visualize handing your baggage back - i don't want this anymore

## Communication Golden Rules
1. name your intentions - because you love your partner and yourself, start serious conversations by setting intentions together
2. see yourselves as a team - working together against common issue
3. start softly - the way you start conversation predicts how it will end (hungry, angry, lonely or tired - do not have the conversation), label your baggage before
4. use "I" language - talk about your personal reactions and experiences, "I feel X and I need Y"
5. go slow - slow speed and one at a time
6. no always/never - it's not accurate
7. listen - try your best to understand and make them feel seen, active listening
8. be compassionate - you're both doing the best you can

- don't ask questions that aren't questions - just state your need
- don't anticipate what you think your partner is going to say and respond to that and not reality
- don't plan response in your head as your partner is talking - actually listen, leave space to breathe

three promises
- give it my best no matter what
- remember they're giving it their best
- goal is worth having

## Conversation 1: Acknowledgment - sex is a thing and we have it
- are you a stranger to yourself?
- get conversation going with past sex experiences you have had with them - talk about or ask them
- put the good stuff first, not complaining just getting comfortable
- have to get comfortable with yourself first, say a word you are ashamed of in the mirror to practice
- start giving your partner specific compliments - light and flirty
Prompts
- favourite sexual memory with me?
- what were you taught to believe about sex? what do you wish you were taught to believe?
- what does good sex mean? what does sex mean to you?
- what does intimacy mean?
Post-sex debrief
- for first all compliments and positives
- second - request something next time
- ask for something new anchored with compliment 
- no criticism

- sex talk morphs into flirting in daily life
- leave notes, catcall them, tell them they're hot and sexy lol

- dry spells are normal life is more than sex
- rip off the bandaid and talk about it because you love them and want to build intimacy

## Conversation 2: Connection - what do we need to be close to each other? (Emotional Intimacy)
- are you strangers to each other?
- two kinds of people - need emotional connection to have sex, need sex to have emotional connection
- spark is twin flames of emotional and physical intimacy
- what makes you connected? all anyone wants is intimacy and closeness
- need emotional connection first - disconnected sex makes you feel less connected
- what are your laws? what makes you and them feel connected?
- start your day/interactions by asking what they need to feel connected to you?
- physical intimacy should not only be related to sex - also just touch for the sake of touch
- bristle reaction - get repulsed when the other touches you - based on belief that all touch is an attempt at sex instead of enjoyable in itself, practice with dedicated time with nonsexual touch
- 30 second hug and 6 second kiss scientifically proven to increase connection
- touched out - reaching limit of touch capacity, especially after giving birth or from kids, prioritize alone time to reconnect with your body and yourself to improve this
- *it sounds like life just sucks - no time with jobs, kids, random issues, fulfillment is lost, too exhausted to care about anything*
- chore play - getting turned on by the other person doing chores without being asked
- you have to put in effort over and over - the fucking fairytale teaches people that partner should just know what you want, in reality asking for what you need does not decrease value of the act
- ==intimacy is daily decisions made over and over again==

## Conversation 3: Desire - what do we need to be turned on? (Physical Intimacy)
- many people feel like they should be having sex more than they are or want to
- talk about what turns you on and off
- sex drive always decreases in long term relationships - need active effort to maintain
- mutual vulnerability - more intimacy, connection and sex
- the minute you stop having sex you start foreplay for the next time - keep the water warm, mutual effort to maintain sex drive simmer
- strong emotional connection makes you more patient
- reframe turn offs into what does turn you on
- one person always needs to initiate - you are being vulnerable to rejection
- initiate sex like an invitation

Different initiation styles (what you say yes to most consistently)
- tease me - anticipation/slow burn tease
- take care of me - do things for me
- play with me - make me laugh
- desire me - knowing partner is turned on/needs you, spontaneity, compliments, assertiveness
- connect with me - emotionally connected
- touch me - any physical touch, appeal to body first

- menu of different sex acts
- just about openness to arousal not immediate readiness - just see where it goes
- respect them saying no - give specific reason, talk about how that reason impacts your ability to show up how you want (why is this a blocker?)
- why is it a no? identify reasons, are there other areas of your life you can say no?
-  make space for disappointment - decide a specific phrase for saying no and expressing disappointment

## Conversation 4: Pleasure - what do we need to feel good?
- map out each others bodies - where do you like to be touched, kissed? try it all out and see what you like. 
- what kind of touch/kiss - soft, aggressive? 
- what energy turns you on? adventurous, affectionate, emotional, creative, focused, fun, generous, gentle, naughty, open minded, playful, relaxed, romantic, safe, silly, slow, vulnerable, thoughtful, warm

**Sex personality types**
Body-based 
1. releaser - bodily release to unwind
2. pleasure seeker - bodily pleasure is a big part of life
Mind based

Spirit based
1. guardian - must feel safe, strong boundaries
2. passion pursuer - want animalistic, passionate sex
3. romantic - sex is about connection and love not physical
4. spiritualist - sex should be transcendent experience

- tell your partner what you want!!!!!!!
- don't have to know you like something to request it - you can be curious without commiting to loving it
- ground feedback in positive - ask for more of what's good not less of what's bad

## Conversation 5: Exploration - what comes next
- ask what they are curious about (less pressure than asking for fantasy)
- go through acts and mark yes, no, maybe together
- suggest alternatives instead of just asking open question
- no judgment even if it's a no
- try something 3 times before deciding if you like it or not
- share why for your curiosity - make it personal to them
- sexual perfectionism - too scared to try anything new because what if it doesn't go well

## When it goes off the rails
- conflicts are missed attempts at intimacy - opportunity to increase intimacy by resolving
- emotional flooding - too much emotional arousal so you cannot respond, cause of stonewalling, step away from conflict for at least 20 minutes, make up code word to signal time out
- best way to shut down defensiveness is validating it 
- share your story to check if it's true before getting upset - just share how you feel without accusation
- goal of communication is understanding - two people can experience same event in completely different way, understand difference between intent and impact, make a plan for next time (start conversation with i love you)
- post argument reconnection ritual to build intimacy

## Making sex a priority
- things don't just happen naturally
- scheduling sex makes it a priority
- actively seduce each other between sex
- average couple spends 35 minutes per week having face to face conversation
- no ideal frequency - whatever works for you
- inertia - break dry spells asap
- have sex before you go out
- communication > connection > more intimacy > better physical connection

## Falling back in love for the rest of your life
- constant effort to maintain intimacy - you, them and the relationship
- *psychologists sure love to use metaphors and giving patterns names*
-  what are 3 things that have most impact on your relationship?
- set intentions in morning about what you can do to make relationship better today
- ==always acknowledge your partner's physical presence== - opportunity to deepen connection
- ask better questions - not just how was your day or transactional
- what initially attracted you to me? when do you find me most attractive? what did you initally love about me? what is something you love about me? what are the core values of our relationship?
- create rituals - 3 things you're grateful for every night, watch wedding video, read books together, cook together, make out every day before you leave and fall asleep
- date night doing new things - need time for just the two of you
- check in regularly - state of our union meeting to get on same page (what do we need more or less of? what are we grateful for? when did we feel closest? highs and lows?)
- gratitude - always acknowledge what you appreciate, most significant predictor of marital quality, positively reinforce behaviours you appreciate
- start and end each day with a few moments of gratitude, share them in the evening
- be bulnerable
