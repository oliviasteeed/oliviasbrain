## Summary
### Context
- Self-help book on relationships by psychiatrist and neuroscientist Dr. Amir Levine and Rachel Heller. Explains [[Attachment Theory]] and how attachment-style influences relationships and relationship longevity. 
### Main Takeaways
- Attachment-style is persistent unless you become aware and take steps to act secure. Secure is the goal. Relationships generally need one secure to work but anxious and avoidants are drawn to each other. This leads to intimacy dance of closeness and results in same patterns of dysfunctional relationships.
- notice protest behaviours (trying to be closer for anxious or farther apart for avoidant) and counteract with secure strategies (effective communication)
- literally just be honest about your needs and if someone can't fulfill your attachment needs it's just incompatibility so win win
### Questions/Connections/Thoughts
- isn't it boring with no games though? 100% forwardness and honesty is not exciting?Â 
- can you have behaviours of each style depending on context/other person?
## Notes
### is love enough?
#### attachment theory
- secure - feel comfortable with intimacy and warm and loving
- anxious - crave intimacy, worried will not reciprocate
- avoidant - avoid intimacy as loss of independence, minimize closeness
- influenced by parents and life experience
- bred to attach to significant other - those who formed intimate bonds survived, brain has attachment system mechanism just to keep us close to loved ones, proximity to loved ones is survival necessity
- protest behaviours (when not near attached) still shown in adulthood
- humans are very heterogeneous - makes us abundant and adaptable to anything
### attachment isn't bad
- only as needy as unmet needs
- when attached you become one physiological unit
- 1920s Watson advice on parenting was to not get close/have strict division, success was complete self control and independence
- now know that nees secure base to feel comfortable venturing out - best way to be independent is to be attached (strange situation test)
- anxious: need a lot of reassurance and can be happy
- avoidant: need autonomy and independence so distance self
- secure: warmth and trust come easy
- two dimensions - comfort with intimacy (avoidance) preoccupation with relationship (anxiety)
- without knowing it most people give away everything you need to know attachment style - readily available
- mindset shift: is this someone i want to invest in? can they give me what i need?
- secure/anxious: basic need to attach
- anxious: want closeness but feel suffocated by it
- feeling unfulfilled/attached to partner creates constant low level tension
### knowing partners attachment style
- do they seek intimacy and closeness? intentions reveal attitude towards it
- sensitivity to rejection
- do not censor yourself - learn if they can meet your needs
- avoidant: distances, devalues, boundaries, unrealistically romantic view of relationships, might make comprises but will feel cheated, communication is unclearÂ 
- secure: communication, compromise, flexible, identify and solve problems
- anxious: wants a lot of closeness, poor communication, self centered, lets other set tone, distrustful
### [[Anxious Attachment]]
- hypersensitive to emotions of others
- relationships activate attachment system and bring out potentially unhealthy traits - activating strategies, depends on other persons attachment style
- attachment system book
- be attuned to needs, reassure early
- protest behaviours - actions to get attention/what comfortable with
- need at least one secure
- avoidant and anxious attraction - confirm each others beliefs
- activated attachment system is not love - love is peace of mind
- don't date avoidant

*i don't love how we're categorizing people so discretely and thinking you have to go for a secure even if you're not into it. activated attachment system isn't love but also maybe everyone is different and i don't want to be so honest i want to be a little tough/ play a little games.*Â 
#### Advice for anxious
- express your genuine needs early to check compatibility early on
- nothing more attractive than being happy and fulfilled
- abundance mindset - they're not your last chance at love
- you make fate happen
- you might feel bored of secures initially - i want violence though
### [[Avoidant Attachment]]
- happiness only real when shared
- avoidance developed for survival in harsh environments?Â 
- avoidants are suppressed anxious coping with distance
- avoidants keep intellectual distance and escape route in relationships
- "what a huge relief it was to let go of such an obsessive notion that set me apart from the rest of the world"
- avoidants are harsher on partners, undercut kind/positive actions to deactivate attachment system
#### coping tools
- longing for the phantom ex (feelings of love return because threat of intimacy is gone and only remember positives)
- looking for the one
### secure
- too accommodating - forgiveness, see wellbeing of other as their problem
- can become less secure with wrong partner

- every time you remember something you reinterpret it and it is altered forever
### relationship inventory
- write everyone you've had relationship with, about relationship, events/issues, emotional response, consider in attachment lens, how does this hurt you, how can you do better next time - secure attachment behaviours (non interference and availability)
- attachment style is stable and plastic - ongoing process
- to live in peace with intimacy struggles (different needs) accept that partner cannot fulfill your needs. if this doesn't work for you leave - it's a one way compromise
#### avoidant anxious magnetic pull
- avoidants avoid sex to push partners away or fantasize about others, forgo intimacy
- avoidants treat people closest as the enemy - because they are closest
### breaking up
- evolutionarily developed to process heartbreak pain same as physical pain, also remember all positives before break up
- when breaking up attachment system goes into overdrive - they can relieve anxiety in a way no other single individual can
### [[How to have healthy conflict]]
#### effective communication
- helpful either way - reveals incompatibility or gets you on same page
- sets the tone for relationship
- insecures can be overwhelmed by emotions and struggle with this
- effective communication is the opposite of protest behaviour
#### secure conflict principles
- show basic concern for other
- maintain focus on problem at hand
- don't generalize conflict
- be willing to engage
- effectively communicate feelings and needs

- don't react with accusation and defensiveness to be secure
#### insecure conflict behaviours to avoid - self centered
- getting sidetracked from real problems
- neglecting to effectively communicate feelings and needs
- reverting to personal attacks and destructiveness
- reacting to partner's negativity with more negativity
- withdrawing
- forgetting to focus on the other's wellbeing
### conclusion
- relationships are too important to be left to chance
- attachment needs are legitimate - just have to find someone compatible, remain authentic to filter out incompatible
