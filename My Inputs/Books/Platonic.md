### Questions/Connections/Thoughts
- 
## Notes
- self care group with friends - pick a wellness activity and engage together each week
- how can others help you if you aren't sharing your needs and struggles?
- feeling connected to others allows you to grow - sharing and feedback
- connection makes you more empathic and bold

- ==platonic love - **love so powerful it transcended physical**, soul connection==
- biggest predictor of wellbeing/not depression is having someone to confide in, factors reducing mortality - excerise 23%, diet 24%, connection 45%

- loneliness is equivalent of smoking 15 cigarettes a day
- eros naked bodies, friendship naked personalities
- disconnected - social cynicism
- connected - trust people more, human optimism
- romantic close friendships used to be more common before being gay was normal

> "what we try to supress defines us"

- if someone loves us we can find ourselves worthy of love
- friends have big impact on who we are because they become important in childhood/adolescence - teach us empathy to care about others and how others will care for us
- **exhale into your full self with a true friend**
- people that remind us of how our life is empty are interpreted as a threat

- friends make us feel human again when we are ashamed

- bobo doll experiment - learning happens from every observation, friends advertise different ways we can live
- self expansion theory - identity needs to constantly expand to be fulfilled, friends become a part of us, being empathic to them is being empathic to ourselves, way to enrich who we are
- emmeshed with others - lose ourself
- friends can also be bad influenceÂ 
- one person can only bring out one side of you, the more friends the more sides you have

> "if i am close to you who i am is deeply and centrally different because of you because who i am deeply and centrally is you"

- study with oxytocin sprayed in nose makes you more empathetic and suceptible to connection - more connections across a life means more oxytocin which prepare you for more connections
- oxytocin - decreases stress, for women can increase anxiety at leaving, for men decreases anxiety

> "the quality of our relationships increases the quality of our life"

> "we don't know ourselves fully until we experience ourselves in another person"

## Impact of Past Relatiomships - Attachment Theory

- whether we make and keep friends depend on us
- superfriends - better at making 'shovel friends' (if you show up at 2am with a body they ask where's the shovel), better mental and physical health, more well adjusted
- superfriend distinguishing quality is security - assume they are worthy of love, open up, assume other like them, forgive, modulate disclosure depending on how others reciprocate, assume they are connected to others
- anxious - worried people will leave, clingy, rush intimacy, struggle to be assertive, "i wake up in the morning and feel alone until someone reaches out", try to merge with people they're close to, overshare to intrigue, give to people that mistreat them, leak feelings passive aggressively or blow up, instance of rejection feels like bodily assault, feel like connection is fleeting, brain responds more intensely to feeling of rejection
- vulnerable narcisism - need validation from others, hupervigilant to rejection so ignore acceptance, from feelings of unworthiness/lack of attention in early life
- avoidantÂ - push others away, leave prematurely, "when friends are out of sight they are forgotten", sarcasm, overwork to distract, self sabotage and pull away indirectly when too close, shame prone, never trust, quick to leave, opt out of responsibility of connection
- object permenance - avoidants have out of sight out of mind for friends so struggle to stay close
- 26-72% of people keep same attachment style through life - parental expectations are only jumping off point, each new relationship influences attachment style - it is a spectrum rather than category, stress and different changes how you act
- to be secure initiate new friendships, intimacy, vulnerable, ask for and provide support, prioritize own and others's needs, take responsibility, forgive, authentic - just don't be so scared, no games
- pronoia - opposite of paranoia, optimism/belief that everything will be okay, assume others are trustworthy, assuming the best sets you up to recieve the best
- reciprocity theory - people treat us how we treat them, secure people make other people more secure

> "what would you do if you could not fail?" - this is just how secures live

- solid sense of self makes secures more authentic, forgiving, lenient while also expressing needs, less defensive
- how to get through to you book
- secures are more accepting of others and better listeners
- American culture - protestant work ethic, good is cool/unphased/detached

> "we'd rather be ruined than be changed"

## Making Friends

Take Initiative
- "one of you has to be proactive" - false belief that it should just happen, give others the gift of initiation
- try to protect ourselves by deferring responsibility to others, this ends up in rejection by nobody initiating

> "some people wait for things to happen and other people claw their way in to make space for themselves"

- loneliness is not a basic tenet of human condition - before 1800 there was no word for loneliness as we know it today, in industrial revolution bonds loosened, people lived alone for first time, less mutual help, communities constantly changing so not as much commitment
- tv makes people less social and more lethargic, social media makes you more lonely if using it instead of in person social interaction
- we are an anti human society - cold, alienating, impedes fundamental desire to be close to others, people have way less friends now (men have 5x less friends in 2021 than 1990)
- seize the moment - be intentional, you have to take initiative it's not just luck
- about keeping in touch with friends
- we should get together book
- internal locus of control - they are responsible for everything in their life, make more friends
- external locus of control - life happens to them, more lonely and powerless feeling
- a romantic partner can not satisfy all your social needs - you need a community, having quality friendships actually make you a better/longer lasting romantic partner
- necessary for forming friendships:Â continuous unplanned interaction and shared vulnerability
- build a community enough so that each new person is not such a big deal

Assume People Like You
- helps you initiate in a positive way, comes from how worthy you feel as a person, how we think others view us is reflection of how we view ourselves, we need to love ourselves to notice others love us

> "how bold one gets when one is sure of being loved" - freud

- anxious - assume nobody likes them because they don't like them - when we assume everyone will reject us we reject them and it becomes self fulfilling prophecy, projections about how people feel about us become more influential than actual reality, much of friendship is ambiguity
- acceptance hypothesis - when people assume they will be accepted they act more warmly and are accepted more - you are in control
- the liking gap: underestimate how much other person likes us, people with most negative self view are the most wrong they are - you are actually liked much more than you think, feeling socially inadequate is not the same as being inadequate
- thinking others are judging you has same effect as others actually judging you

> "our thoughts often hurt us more than our bullies do"

- not going well? is it your thoughts or their behaviours?Â 
- just be proud of yourself for initiating, you already win

Say Hello
- create a social situation, not just showing up but talking to people
- assume you aren't being rejected
- perception of social climate depends on how active you areÂ 
- overt avoidance - not showing up, trying to avoid being hurt but feels worse in long run
- covert avoidance - showing up physically, checking out mentally, not taking initiative
- avoidance is cause of social anxiety - overcome by repeatedly exposing to it and realizing you can, if you continuously avoid it gets worse
- people will be relieved rather than upset you approached them

Making Friends
- the spark is real - initial assessment of friendship potential is usually correct so don't force it
- propinquity - you are likely to become friends with people you are often physically close to, reduces cost to see them (initially cost is huge influencer if you become friends, later not as much), if we know we will see someone again we like them more/are more invested - need to put yourself out there to write your own fate and up chances of connections
- mere exposure effect - we like people we are more familiar with even if just seeing them more and not even interacting, choose continuous events instead of one offs, keep showing up, it gets better, initiate unapologetically again and again, at least 3 month timeframe, initiate something with favourite person outside of group
- if you want more friends expose yourself to as many people as possible on regular basis
- spontaneous interaction with others, share statement and then ask them a question
- study - nobody shoots down talking to stranger on train, everyone is waiting to be activated
- bumping into people you know makes the world feel warm
- talk to strangers - everyone wants to be approached
- to make a friend we must be a friend, be the friend you want, it's about what you can bring

## Expressing Vulnerability

> "vulnerability is the deepest form of authenticity"

- shame is when we feel like our authentic self is not worth love
- what feels vulnerable to you is cultural/social construct
- content and behaviour need to match to be truly vulnerable - sound vulnerable but doesn't look it, package to make it more palatable, the issue is emotions are cues to how others should react, less social support when supressing your feeings, less satisfied with relationships
- show full body vulnerability - you get a flat response when you don't show how much it means to you
- rising strong book
- when we are weak we are connected to everyone - share to get closer to others and feel peace, "i felt the flow of love between me and the people around me",Â do emotions exist to bring us together? weakness is actually glue of happiness?
- supressing thoughts make you more preoccupied by it, express them to evaporate
- avoidants supress more, preoccupied by feelings suppressed, if you are distracted can no longer supress, only have rebound effect when distracted (otherwise always supressing), become more insecure
- disclosure doc
- people have become much less vulnerable over last 20 years, hurting us and making us connect yet
- assume we will be judged negatively for vulnerability but judge others more positively, we actually like vulnerable people more and feel closer to them
- to fall in love with anyone do the aron questions
- conveys authenticity, honesty, trust and liking for the other
- giving others opportunity to help us improves wellbeing, closeness and meaning to them - don't be afraid of burdening others
- share gradually, if you overshare immediately seems anxious and makes that your whole personality to them - ask why you are sharing
- without vulnerability there is ceiling of closeness we cannot cross
- self compassion book
- self compassion - self kindness, mindfulness, shared humanity
- doesn't always feel good - do painful things that align with your values
- also feel comfortable not being vulnerable, are they the right audience? - *work on this* - people are bad at knowing when we're lying so you don't have to tell them everything
- scaffold vulnerability - start with people who are sure bet to recieve it, then try others - not so much pressure on each
- repetition compulsion - return to place hurt to ease pain of past hurt, usually leads to more pain
- loneliness is lack of people you can be vulnerable with
- men are less vulnerable in friendships - usually have third activity to distract, are vulnerable only with romantic partners - have to take first step and others will follow
- dominance causes worse wellbeing than equality relationships 
- not being vulnerable - breathing shallow and calling it a life
- sharing issues with trusted/supportive others makes you better at coping with them
- we perceive others' vulerability as brave and feel increased intimacy with them while assuming us being vulerable will be met with ridicule

## Authenticity
- raw - knee jerk reaction, selfish
- authenticity - state of presence accessed when not hijacked by defense mechanisms, allowing ourselves to feel internal honesty and emotions, responsive not reactive, intentional not primal, intentional balance of our needs and theirs so can include accommodating others

> "what cannot be communicated to the mother cannot be communicated to the self" - Bowlby, father of attachment theory

True self as morally good core under defense mechanisms
- we have sense of true self as morally good - must confront scars to become unimpeded from higher self
- when primed with security we are more kind and compassionate - security is secret to kindness, if you are suffering you do not have resources for empathy - self protection mode - cutting off from relationships, security mode - can support others because not consumed by their pain
- transcend book - Maslow's self actualization

Security is kindness
- do internal work of security - HTWFAIP engratiation is inauthentic and becomes exhausting, immoral and impure - need to become authentically warm because suppressing the self causes depression
- mutuality - zooming out to consider others' needs, natural for secure, for insecure do not act on first impulse (defense mechanism), intentionally have mutuality
- *do defense mechanisms have no value though? why do they exist then? can you really be mushy and fully authentic all the time it's exhausting*

Self awareness to evade defense mechanisms
- self awareness - know how it feels to be triggered/insecure so you can avoid knee jerk coping mechanisms
- goal is full appreciation of each other
- projection - how you feel isn't indication of other person's character
- mindfullness - pause, breathe, evaluate
- how to be yourself book
- overcome self consciousness by focusing on the other person not your self

Rejection
- do not let relationships limit your life (death and loss)
- secure - self worth not based on others' approval or judgments
- anxious - too close, entire identity based on someone else
- avoidant - keep distance, uneffected by rejection and love of others
- absence is not rejection - hold them loosely enough for space

> "I don't take a lot of things personally"

- embrace optimism of the secure - "tragically optimistic"

> "to hope is to give yourself to the future." - believe that everything will be alright in the end
- rejection is inevitable so mind as well be authentic

Inequality
> "priviledge means access to authenticity"

- code switching - sociolinguistic labour, mental cost

- give and take book
- 3 vs of vulnerability - vet, vulnerability, voice concerns
- prejudice feels cumulative - reflects whole life
- authenticity - not just not caring what others think or being callous against criticism - putting yourself in spaces you can be authentic
- adjusted mutuality - disadvantaged groups need to have more status whebn groups come together, only goes well when privileged group perspective takes and less privileged shares
- best way to dismantle prejudice is cross group friendships but requires less advantaged to be more vulnerable 

## Conflict
Anger - do not supress
- anger of hope - express unmet needs constructively - strengthens relationships
- anger of despair - feel betrayed/given up on relationship so lash out - hurts relationships
Safety
- flacid safety - comfort from constant supression
- dynamic safety - strength built from addressing, continually breaking down and building up, expressing anger benefits relationships if you do it productively - voice constructively, looking for resolution
- the only litmus test for if you should bring something up is if it continues to impact you
Addressing Conflict
- consider what this friend gives you that nobody else does
- intentions for discussion
- acknowledge your role
- imagine yourself split in two - higher you and you on the ground, you don't have to act on knee jerk reaction
Avoid Escalation
- put confict in front of you not between you
- use "we" or "our" statements
- acknowledge when they have a point
- pause and act about their perspective - deflates defensiveness
Grow From It
- ask for what you want instead

> "soulmates aren't always romantic"
- yup 
- soulmates - ease and unconditional love, open discussion

> "conflict is one of the only times we get honest feedback about ourselves"
- defensiveness is missing chance for insight

Be Responsive
- understanding - active listening/show you understand why they are upset
- validation - validate their response
- care - what will you do next time

- you don't have to agree to understand and be responsive

- treat others how they want to be treated not you want to be treated
- conflict is not over until there is no tension
- not every friend needs to be best friend - low dosage friends
- what do they add to your life that no one else does?

## Generosity
- protestant work ethic that made the us - do until you no longer can, give everything - selfless
- 1980s self esteem movement - pendelum swings to self absorbed
- cultivating self esteem without concern for others leads to narcissism (on the rise now) - supporting others is "emotional labour" and being taken advantage of - *who do we think we are????*
- the biography of loneliness book
- give and take book adam grant

> =="the internet has given us relationships built on shared interests without accountability to each other"==
- only want the good but none of the effort, community means obligation to each other

- fight, flight, fawn - give to people to try to earn love, acting generously to feel better yourself - worse for wellbeing than altruism
- goal is not selflessness but enlightened self interest - give and take, when we sacrifice to give we become unmitigated givers - worse wellbeing and resentment, more stressed and depressed, worse relationships
- "when we are absorbed by others, we shed the parts of ourselves we want to escape... we're so consumed by people, we forget for a moment the heaviness of being a person"
- understand what you are trying to run away from, aspire to generosity equilibrium so it is sustainable
- **give** yourself permission to ask for what you want
- rules of generosity change for closest friends - saying internet stuff like "im at capacity reach out later" is a betrayal - high quality friends are expected to be there to support in times of needÂ 
- what's appropriate depends on closeness - communal relationships - deepest and most vulnerable, give even if it costs us, definition of love, support deeply, listening, cheering them up, we find them when we give them - support in times of need is key factor that makes us more secure, makes us reciprocate
- "boundaries" are justified individualism from self esteem movement, healthy/communal boundaries are offering what you can even if it is not always the same - we prioritize someone else in crisis unless we are in crisis ourselves, protect the relationship while also protecting ourselves
- academic argument about communal relationships played out over series of research papers lol
- "unspoken expectations are premeditated resentments" - tell people what you need and share what you are going through so people have accurate expectations, give to each other, affirm that their needs are important
- being selfish makes you lonely! be a friend to your friendsÂ 
- larger network means less strong connections, research finds that half our friends don't consider us friends
- love is automatic empathy - giving to them is giving to us, love is well of energy to help

## Affection
- no white lies, total honesty
- gush about each other
- romatic friendships - we are limited by social norms of what friends should be, only permission to be affectionate with significant others, friends are more transient, potentially uncomitted, no script
- technology - loose tie culture, instead ask who you want to keep in your life in an intentional way
- sexual love and romantic/passionate love are different things - best friends are excited about each other, territorial, idealize
- traditional view that marriage could not be for something as fragile as love, man and woman need to come together to complete each other but too different to connect so form romantic friendships with same sex, distance between friends started with rise of homophobia - once homosexual became a sexual disorder/sexual identity, when people moved to cities they were less barred by small town expectations so did all kinds of sex stuff, psych and homophobia was used to control this into protestant work ethic
- straight book
- feel pressure to conceal best friend love - homohysteria

Express Affection - intimacy
- express affection for each other - makes you closer no matter how close you are all ready
- people like people who like them, most important quality of friends is making us feel good, we want to feel like we matter
- immediacy - becoming closer by sharing what you like about people, we think it will freak them out but they actually like us more
- safety is cultivated through vulnerability and affection
- protecting ourselves is at odds with protecting our relationships
- invest in others and they will invest in us
- affection makes our friends feel secure - know they can trust us, melt into secure - everything you do makes people more or less secure
- more satisfied with relationships when they are happy for our joy than when upset for our pain
- risk regulation theory - making friends is about making other people feel safeÂ 
- feel, express, received as affection
- lower self esteem downplay and don't see affection cues to avoid feeling rejection
- "low self esteem can make another's love feel threatening"
- show others affection, ask how they want it

## Conclusion
- friendship is more important for wellbeing than healthy eating and exercise
- don't take friends for granted! they are the light of life! reach out first!
