## Notes
### Introduction
- your body is not an apology
- every natural thing has natural intelligence to become the highest form of itself, innate perfect design
- she calls natural intelligence 'radical self love', not a destination, who you actually are
- how do we stop forgetting the answer so we can get on with our loves
### Chapter 1
- self esteem and self confidence are fleeting
- we have self acceptance when we are too tired for self hatredÂ 
- change what you can't accept don't accept what you can't change
- you can have radical self love because you already have it
- **material reality not abstraction to empathize with the body**
- radical: to the point, extreme, deepest level, self love as root as relationship to themselves
- children do not arrive ashamed, wonder at the body is unlearned, we arrived on this planet as love
- media - using bodies as foder for entertainment
- all traits linked and connected with others - intersectionality
- radical self love basis for radical human love - how we view our body shapes how we view and accept others
- there is no right way to have a body
- space is infinite - there is no taking up too much space
- not knowing is an opportunity for exploration
- alleviation of suffering is acceptance
- HAES concept - health at any size
- **however you are will be contagious so spread radical self love instead of self hatred**
- spreading radical self love is the biggest change you can make in the world
### Chapter 2
- **invisibility is a statement**Â 
- all our body roles are made up, most influential information source is media
- global body shame profit complex - advertising becoming source of revenue for news
- **collectively spending more on beauty than 3/4 of nation economies**
- economic systems inform what we are compelled to do and buy, distort us and then sell us remedies
- $15,000 spent on beauty products over average US woman's lifetime
- relationship with money reflects relationship with body
- humans are masters of distraction - use beauty/aesthetics as a distraction from harder/greater things
- take power back
- best interest buying (reflects commitment to radical self love, resources spent on what deeply value in life, is it rooted in radical self love, deeply reflect on purchases meaning/value/impacts) v. detriment buying (motivations based on feeling not enough, do i truly know i am no less worthy without, will not fix any percieved flaw)
- compassionately ask why
- unapologetically adorned
- am i changing my body in a way i will be rewarded for?
- governments created by people just as indoctrinated, have power to codify indoctrination, have power to protect or oppress bodies
- central currency of government = power, power belongs to men
- most nations have a default body - in government, how people are valued and judged against, age old system of control
- body shame flourishes because profit and power depends on it
- body shame/body terrorism (terror as means of coercion) takes away your power
- if you could share something with leila what would it be? write it doen and share it with yourself on hard days
- body terrorism - instructed to inspect groins that appear to differ from presented gender
- appraisal is powerful - is true freedom not letting it effect yo
### Chapter 3:
#### To Overcome Body Shame:
- make peace with not understanding
- make peace with difference
- make peace with ourself/body

- you came to this world as pure love, body shame depends on your forgetting
- comparison is theif of joy
- body shame depends on body hierarchy
- if we are open to it we will find confirmation of our divine pathway all around us
- difference between fear and danger
- what is unexplored inside you because of fear?
- radical self love is return to full self, thinking, being, doing
- you are not your thoughts: say thank you and peacefully let it go
- children - pure loveÂ 
- 4 pillars of practice: take out toxic, mind matters, unapologetic action, collective compassion (emanate/radiate)
- your body is not an apology workbook
- limit media - does this show/ads align with my values?
- your brain is part of your body
- familiarity breeds liking - get to know your body
### Chapter 4
- how we feel about ourselves is reflected in how we treat everyone else
- being nice isn't enough, fight back against body shame
- you need to learn to speak a different language than body shame
- only foundation for changed world is inner transformation - without addressing learned bias new leaders will be just as bad
- challenge body shame based statements
- open dialog about body shame and identity/oppression - build connection and understanding
- have compassion for and honour everyone's experience. there was a time before you had your experiences/knowledge too
- fear is not danger
- way we respond is reflection of own journey
- avoid the desire to derail
- attacks are unhelpful, hate devolves dialog
- practice unapologetic inquiry
- the answers we stick with over time are the ones we come to ourselves
- celebrate difference
### Chapter 5: how to fight with love
- see others whole being and body
- impossible to interact with radical self love and remain unaltered
- *emergent strategy book*
- what you pay attention to grows
- shame keeps you from your quest to understanding, keeps you small and trapped
- be aware of the norms you create through consumption - familiarity
- not just accept but worship the body
- _fearing the black body book_
- normalize access needs - ask for them like promounds, destigmatize differences, interrupt default body as able body
- infinite arrangements of expressing desire and identity - who does the default body shrink or erase?
- queer: escaping definition
- equity over equality - equality is easy and industrialized, equity is nuance and acknowledges what everyone needs
- _so you want to talk about race book_
- you don't need to be a neonazi to have systems of racism, you just have to do nothing
- _seeing white podcast_
- _me and white surpremecy workbook_
#### Interrupt Body Terrorism
- speak up with compassion, even when challenges default comfort
- invitation to challenge requires discomfort
### Conclusion
- liberation is unobstructed access to best self, radical self love
