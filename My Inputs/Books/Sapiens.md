## Summary
leos
### Context
- book on evolution/anthropological history of humans
### Main Takeaways
- nothing is natural and normal, nowms are formed by culture which is always changing and being influenced - no pure culture
- slow shift to universal megaculture
- society stays afloat through shared myths - delusions we share to induce cooperation and know how to imteract with people
- productivity means ability to produce sellable goods
- every progress has made us more miserable
### Questions/Connections/Thoughts
- are we doomed? like where do you go from here?
- how do you fix culture?
## Notes
## Introduction
- used to be 6 kinds of humans at once, moved to different environments, adapted to cold, low resources
- genus homo species sapiens, humans refers to all homo
- large brain is hard to maintain, uses 25% of energy on brain when at rest
- muscles atrophy when brain takes up energy - this is why humans are weaker than chimps
- sapiens uniquely walk upright - pay with stiffness, sore back, mothers giving birth prematurely - needed tribe to raise child so social ties were selected for
- born underdeveloped - more suceptible to socialization and education
- first tools were to crack open bones for marrow - that was humans' first niche
- humans jumped into top of food chain - usually this happens slowly so ecosystem to adjust, gain elegance and confidence, so fast that humans are still scared and stupid
- fire was main part of this - clear land, weapon, cooking - less energy consumption needed to digest so less intestines needed, smaller teeth/jaw, more energy allocated to brain
- power no longer depends on physical design or body
## Other human species
- 150,000 years ago homo sapiens were in Africa, spread into Arabia 70,000 years ago
- what happened to other humans? - interbreeding (eurasians are sapiens and neanderthals, chinese and korean are sapiens and erectus), or replacement (different mating habits or could not produce fertile children, sapiens killed off all other human populations)Â 
- implications for racismÂ 
- evidence for interbreeding - 1-4% of dna in europe is neanderthal dna, 6% of dna of modern australian is indigenous populations is denisovan dna, probably interbred and replaced
- neanderthals - larger, bigger brains, adapted to life into cold
- grey areas - different populations start as related, become almost but not quite unrelated so could produce some fertile offspring
- we are the last human species,Â 
- probably conquered world 70,000 years ago because of language
## Knowledge - cognitive revolution
- ancient sapiens looked like us but did not think like us, 70,000 years ago they exterminated all other human species
- 70-30,000 years ago boats, oil lamps, art, culture -Â **cognitive revolution from gene mutation from pure chance - language**
- the recombinable nature of our language makes it different, needed social sharing - gossip among social groups, we are extremely social species and adapted to live in groups and develop connections and collaboration 
- we were made to gossip lol
- cognitive revolution - sapiens can talk about things that do not exist, unique among language (not only functional)
- fiction allows for collective beliefs of myths - can cooperate with huge groups with common belief
- chimpanzees 20-50 individuals, hierarchical, larger than that ruptures, if they don't all have relationships they cannot trust one another
- cognitive revolution - 150 individual group is max for humans, past this need formalized structure - large numbers of strangers can cooperate based on common myths in shared imagination (religion, legal myth, nationalism) - none of these things exist in the universe outside of us
- what is a company? where does it exist? all parts can be replaced and it can still exist? no connection to physical world so exists in imagination - legal fictionÂ 
- invention of LLC legally independent from people makes people free of risk, immortal, promoted corporations to major players in society -Â creation of a new god
- just like religion fictions, rituals, spells, everything is made up
- fiction, social construct, imagined reality - not lying, everyone believes it
- "the un, libia and human rights are all figments of our fertile imagination" lol
- we live in dual reality of real world and imagined realities that now control physical reality
- speed of cultural evolution unique to sapiens, in other species behaviour is limited to genetics,Â **sapiens bypass biological evolution for social evolution**
- religion reproduces with nonbiological means - childless elites
- key to success is ability to compose fiction and rapidly adapt
- no animal other than sapiens engages in trade - trade is based on trust and common fictions
- sapiens started hunting in groups, prepare and save food together - as opposed to others who hunt alone
- imagined realities - cultures
- until cognitive revolution history and biology were one, after history becomes own discipline - behaviour is more than biological
- sapiens are able to gather in thousands without chaos - mythical glue that binds us with strangers
- *evolution past the body? physical reality no longer has a role to play/value?*
## Hunter gatherer roots
- we are adapted to hunter gatherer environment - environment now makes us feel depressed, confused, meaningless
- we binge on food because evolved in time when it's not always there - take it before it's gone
- nonmonogamy - collective fatherhood, belief child is born from accumulation of sperm from many men
- more communal - debate over
- naturalness of nuclear family
- foragers were nomadic so had very few artifacts, beliefs and relationships mediated without objects - everything we do now is mediated by objects

- *no hard evidence of digital communication - what will be remembered from us? just a bunch of garbage? without internet do we have a legacy?*

- hunter gatherer societies were all different because humans are so suceptible to socialization - no natural way to be since cognitive revolution
- foragers - needed tons of knowledge of surroundings and environment, mastery over body, more interesting life with less work, health and lack starvation came from varied diet so not dependent on one (peasants and factory workers after them had shit life)
- most infectious diseases from animals
- foreager societies are all different because human behaviour is not biologically determined

- animates - no boundary between all life, everything is alive and has something to say
- theists - believe in hierarchical god controlling and ruling other life
## Agriculture
- sapiens are reason for 3 mass extinctions, killed most of large mammals
- agriculture only happened where it was possible (not fungi, not ferocious beasts)
- hunter gatherers had better lives than agricultural - less work and better diet
- wheat domesticated humans, led to fencing, watering, settled life, labour causing ailments
- agriculture not great for individual but supported population boom in specific areas - currency of evolution is dna copies - ability to keep more people alive in worse conditions
- accidental trap consisting of stages with small changes to daily life - started with temporary harvest camps, spending all time taking care of crops, able to have more children but higher mortality, weaned earlier, worse immune systems, more exposed to degredation
- yes we will have to work harder but we will have a better life - did not understand the longterm outcomes
- couldn't go back because population growth and generational knowledge - nobody knows of time before
- **luxuries become necessities we cannot live without** - i've saved all that time and effort but do i live a more relaxed life? no it just exponentially grows amount you can do
- maybe humans had ideology
- breeding for fat stupid livestock animalsÂ 
- human society built on brutality towards animals
- discrepency between evolutionary success and wellbeing is hallmark of agricultural evolution
## Home
- agriculture builds attachment to home, accumulate more things, fence between artificial human world and wild/outside - could not leave, cycles of production, constant work, need for excess in bad times, worries about future became pervasive because survival depended on it,Â **putting off pleasure to work hard now in hopes of future excess**
- hunter gatherers had whole territory as home, very few possessions, limit to longterm planning because were not super in control
- **maximum affluence is when a civilization falls apart** - not enough time to develop instinct for mass collaboration
## Law
- first laws were eye for an eye
- there is no objective equality - just traits that make you more or less likely to survive
- there are no rights just abilities and organs in biology
- believe in imagined order so we can cooperate with large groups - what we believe becomes real and forms society
- human rights exist only in human imagination - exist for order, imagined order is always in danger of collapse, needs upkeep/enforcement
- to keep it together some people have to genuinely believe it, insist it is genuinely real, indoctrinate from birth
## Keeping imagined order alive
- imagined order woven into material society (individualism)
- imagined order shapes desires (every ad is myth that consuming something else - product or service - will make life better)
- romantic myths - romanticism says in order to make the most of human experiences we must expose ourselves to as many different experiences as possible
- consumerist myths - in order to be happy we must consume as many
- products or services as possible, every ad 
- personal desires are programmed by imagined orderÂ - romanticism and consumerism are double punch of selling myths
- most people in most cultures dedicate lives to building pyramids - just different names
- imagined order is intersubjective - even if an 
- objective - exists independent of humans
- subjective - exists depending on consciousness and beliefs on an individual
- intersubjective - phenomena exists within communication network, linking group of individuals - if one stops believing it doesn't matter. money, god, companies, 
- "there is no way out of the imagined order - when we break down own prison walls and run towards freedom we are in fact running into the more spacious exercise yard of a bigger prison."
- *do we really believe or are we desperate for control?
## Memory
- large societies require knowledge of too much information for one person to hold, other species have this encoded into their genome so they don't need laws
- capacity is limited, knowledge dies with humans - gets garbled after a few generations, only evolved to handle botanical and spatial data (hunter gatherer)
- math became important for large societies - brain not meant to process this so mental math capacity limit kept human social networks small until writing - invented for storing informatiom outside of the brain using signs
- first writing was practice lists and economic documents
- *when did writing become art and not strictly functional? with religious texts?*
- full script - can express everything people can say
- partial scripts - only works for specific scenario/fill in gap of spoken script
- mesopotamia developed first full script cuneiform - laws, religious texts and letters, then translated oral stories to written script
- issue became too many cuneiform tablets - basically external longterm memory so defeating the purpose of ease of storing outside of brain - **organization of data harder and slower to develop than development of writing itself**
- **in brain all information is freely associated, in beaurocracy all things are kept apart in categories - this has biased human thought towards categorization**
- *wait but psych says we naturally want categories is this really learned*
- mathematical script keeps entire disciplines alive gave rise to binary script that we are taught to think like now
## Justice
- every hierarchy denies it's imaginary status and claims to be natural
- people think theirs makes sense but everybody else's system is crazy
- no society has even been able to dispense with discrimination - hierarchies and discrimination are always present to create order because they tell us how to treat each other without knowing each other
- hierarchy and castes are results of chance political events not universal cosmic truth, just perpetuated and amplified/justified over time but based on imagination
- purity and pollution also play role in discrimination - taking advantage of natural disgust at sickness and death
- need to be seen as moral and good leads to myths demonizing lower classes - reducing [[Cognitive Dissonance]]
- black racism - results of discrimination become justification for discrimination
## Sexism
- people everywhere have divided themselves into men and women
- women were property of men, rape meant you had to pay man who owned her and now she's his wife
- masculinity and femininity are imagined reality
- biology enabled, culture forbids
- biology says nothing is unnatural, anything possible is natural, idea of unnatural comes from christian theology - god made us for purpose (natural)

## Culture
- everything humans make has inherit contradiction, as opposed to scientific laws
- *is this why we worship science/objectivity?*
- cultures evolved as shared myth to keep larger groups together
- used to believe cultures had an unchanging essence, now know they are constantly in flux to adapt to new needs/ environments 
- all cultures have contradictions - this is best way to understand the values of the people
- evolved to see us and them
- authentic culture - uninfluenced by others
- cultures are all influenced by each other now (spanish chilis in indian food)
- history is gradual unification of authentic cultures into megacultures - then these split apart and come back together
- used to be discrete human cultures like earth was whole galaxy, now we are one capitalist monoculture
## Money
- universal shared myth - unites everyone
- favours only works in small group where you know everyone
- trade made people into specialists instead of generalists - no longer can self sustain
- barter only works if you want what others can trade you, requires constant invention of exchange rates
- money - creation of new intersubjective reality existing solley in imagination, allows to quickly compare and store value
- evolved many times using many currencies (shells, pelts, metal, cigarettes)
- sum total of money in world is 60 trillion dollars, sum total of physical money is less than 6 trillion - most exists only on computers in electronic data
- most basic quality - everyone always wants money because everyone else also wants money, anything can be converted into anything else (health for justice), can be stored way easier than physical resources
- allowed growth of commercial networks
- money based on most universal trust system ever devised - inescapable, this is why they are tied to political and social climate
- money started with using actual material resources (barley in mesopotamia - unconditioned response), once trust built there, switched to shared imagination and symbolic value like weights in silver (conditioned response) - *money is classical conditioning*
- need mark of authenticity - became coins minted by king/ruler, counterfeiting strong punishment
- gold and silver - established global trading networks, single monetary monoculture 
- "disease of the heart" - desire for money
-  forces of supply and demand normalize value across two resources
- only trust system that can bridge any gap - allows cooperation across huge groups, any two people can cooperate
-  money corrodes local traditions, values (love, loyalty, trust) - these cannot be converted into money so less valued, builds further trust in money, not in each other, becomes heartless marketplace without non monetary values

## Imperialism
- an empire that cannot sustain a blow and remain standing is not really an empire
- there is no justice in history
- empire is political order ruling over many groups of distinct cultures, flexible borders with insatiable appetite
- imperial influence in every culture - spanish, portugese, french and english - you can't return to authentic culture, just another empire

## Religion
- gods are superhuman was to enforce rules and morality between humans
- started with animism - everything is aive - then one god when hunter gatherers in small 100x100km radius, then became many gods when territory expanded and needed to explain more natural phenomena
- monotheism is relatively new brainwashing
- within religion violence just as if not more brutal than between religion
- polytheist - their god is not supreme leader, accept other religions
- monotheist - god is supreme and all others must be exterminated
-  dualistic religion - entire universe is battle between good and evil, explains problem of evil but who created the rules good and evil abide by?
- natural law religions - gods abide by laws or nature too (buddhism, janism, epicureanism, stoicism), life is a pointless rat race full of suffering, suffering always a result of the human mind
- always dissatisfied and restless, think will never find or want better when do find, if you accept experience as it is without craving you can release suffering - mindfullness focusing on what experiencing now instead of what want to be experience, nirvana is no desire
- "a person who does not crave cannot suffer" - once craving arises in one's mind all the gods in the world cannot save them
- dharma - suffering arises from craving
- buddhism - human/nonhuman beings with capacity to achieve liberation from suffering but don't for compassion to human beings - give guidance and advice
- modern natural law religions - capitalism, liberal humanism, nationalism
- humanist religion - homo sapiena are most important and worshipped 
- liberal humanism - freedom for all, based on inner core in all humans protected by human rights - legacy of soul from monotheism, disproved thus far by science
- socialist humanism - equality, built on monotheist belief of all equal souls
- evolutionary humanism - nazis, must uphold natural selection, only one free of monotheist beliefs - ended up discrediting racism after WW2
- "to fight against nature is to bring about one's own destruction"
- type 1 chaotic system - does not respond to prediction (weather)
- type 2 chaotic system - responds to prediction so can never be accurately predicted (stocks, history)
- cultures are mental parasites that emerge accidentally - memetics, culture reproduces through memes 
- postmodernism - culture propogates through discourse with little consideration for human wellbeing
- game theory - behaviours that hurt everyone develop in patterns (arms race) - harm everyone but spread 
- most successful cultures are not necessarily the best for humans - history is like evolution - natural selection of ideas that spread

## Scientific revolution
- last 500 years humanity gains power to end itself
- modern science - willingness to admit ignorance, centrality of observation and mathematics, acquisition of new powers (using new theories) - revolution of ignorance - realizing that humans do not know everything about the world
- religion tells you everything you need to know - anything else is irrelevant otherwise would be included in religious texts/teachings so keeps you ignorant
- science - true until disproven, makes us more inquisitive than any past humans because biases towards new observations instead of only studing past (like religion) - issue is shared myths may be wrong, may errode social order (depend on liberal humanism - disproven by science, religious belief in technology)
- mathematics instead of narratives - "the book of nature is written in the language of mathematics"
- last 200 years statistics developed to manage additional complexity - economics
- before logic, rhetoric and theology were the most important studies, now mathematics are important and pervasive in other disciplines (psychology, science)
- Francis Bacon - knowledge is not about truth, about empowering us, connected science and technology for 'progress'
-  until scientific revolution humans did not believe in progress - better times were golden eras in the past, did not believe humans could solve new problems - it was hubris to attempt to go beyond human limitations
- most faiths saw death as ultimate point of life, turned death into meaning of life
- science doesn't give meaning to death - instead solving technical problems to evade death - "leading project of scientific revolution is to evade death"
- science is expensive so is created and proliferated by ideologies shaping it - what is profitable and valuable?

## Science and empire
- science only gets done if it is politically or economically beneficial - who wants/funds it and what do they want
- almost everyone in the world sees world from European lens - dress, thought, taste, politics, music, production/economics, medecine, war - why? transport with railways and scientific attitude
- discovery of America was foundation of scientific revolution - admitting we don't know instead of just filling in maps
- Europeans were the exception with desire to take over other places - everyone else just kept to themself 

## Money
- 90% of all money in bank accounts is not real
- all founded on trust in an imaginary future - credit - build in present depending on future, allows for more growth than if limited to only tangible assets available now, only works if you trust future will be better - progress and development from scientific revolution - if we admit ignorance and learn more we can improve
- allows you to break out of current place/caste - expectation of stagnation fulfills it
- the idea of progress - more trust in future
- the wealth of nations book - increase in private profits is what fuels collective wealth (hiring more people) - says greed is good and egoism is altruism, radical perspective to justify capitalism, denied contradiction between wealth and morality and put rich on pedestal, profits must be reinvested in increasing production ad infinitum (this is not sustainable) - before people believed profits were constant so didn't try to grow
- *belief in progress is new religion*
- capitalism started as theory, now is a belief that economic growth is the surpreme good bringing about all other good - value comes only from things that can increase profit (implications for what science is funded)
- goes against every law of the universe, infinite growth is impossible
- better to do business with merchants than kings - they have to repay you, rule of law is respected. merchants made the empire not the rulers
- *evolution simply favours what survives not what is good*

## Energy
- all human production was based on sun's energy - into plants to be eaten and used by us as physical expenditure
- industrial revolution - conversion of one energy to another, view that the Earth has limitless energy we just need to invent more ways to harness it
- human productivity - production of sellable goods - rises, supply outpaces demand so capitalism needs consumerism to stay afloat 
- consumerism - for much of history there was not enough so deprivation was a moral good, the rich were excessive and hedonistic and the poor lived in deprivation, now the poor live in excess and only rich are careful with money
- what is normal now in consumerist society would have been disgusting and immoral then
- consumerism is only religion where followers live in accordance to standards, all others it is too hard to live up to all the time
- value only in what is economically beneficial - agriculture industry treats animals and plants like machines to serve us a good while denying psychological subjective needs because fulfilling them has no financial benefit
- reality of evolutionary psychology is once a subjective need is created naturally, it needs to be fulfilled even if objective need it stems from is already fulfilled (social, parental bonding)
- play is how animals learn social behaviour
- being deprived of socialization means you cannot integrate later on with society and have mood/depressive issues - *can this be remedied or are you just ruined? i guess you learn another kind of norm and don't share the myths that generally keep cooperation and groups together*

## Post Industrial Revolution
- nature cannot be destroyed, it just changes
- used to live with seasonal cycles and sun, no regard for time because relatively autonomous
- industrial revolution - everyone depends on each other so everyone needs to be there at the same time - living on artificial timeframe
- industrial revolution also broke bonds of family and gave their responsibilities to state - family used to be the first step of help/support, then community, state stayed out of day to day business of citizens
- the state offered individuality - you don't have to conform to family or community, you can do whatever you want, in actuality it allows state to exploit people and control every part of their lives (just another kind of control)
- *industrialization is slow progression of increased individualization at cost of social bonds and belonging 
- bonds and belonging 
- "the state and the market are the mother and father of the individual"
- imagined community - don't really know each other but imagine they do - intersubjective realities that are real so long as they exist in our imagination - creates nationalism
- consumer tribes - defined by what they consumed (media fan, vegetarian, environmentalism)
- social order is no longer static over last 2 centuries, used to be "this is how it has always been," now in a state of constant flux, every year is a revolution
- currency of politics is no longer to return to past golden age but create new world
- elastic order can maintain and initiate constant change without falling apart
- we live in the most peaceful era of all time
- control of state caused decrease of violence - no longer have to settle scores yourself
- cannot have war because states are not independent, cannot even engage in war independently - world empire
- current perspective on history depends on recent events (*biases truth of past - is any history true or is it just based on attitudes at the time?)*

## The end - where are we now and what was the point of this?
- are we actually happier than hunter gatherers? **what was the point?** 
- "we are destroying the foundations of human prosperity in an orgy of reckless consumption"
- *good, bad, hard to say*
- happiness is independent from weath and health, social and spiritual factors mean more than material goods for happiness
- measuring happiness by just asking people in different demographics - averages are dangerous, direction of causation
- money brings happiness up to a point, after that doesn't matter
- chronic illness only brings temporary unhappiness if it doesn't get progressively worse/cause chronic pain
- community (family, good marriage, warm community) brings more happiness than materials - material world offset by individuality
- **happiness depends on difference between subjective and objective conditions - hedonic adaptation**
- we may suffer more pain now because of how we expect no pain or suffering
- expectations are reality
- advertising and mass media are causes of discontent because they give you other standards/expectations
- even if immortality was real it would be chaos - rich (who can) stop taking risks because so scared of death, poor upset they have to die when others don't
- people are made happy by only pleasant sensations in body regulated by neurotransmitters - stays relatively constant
- people have different natural happiness ranges - *I think you always have a choice*
- cannot exceed upper or lower limits???
- happiness is not pleasure but meaning - things that make you happy are not pleasurable in the moment
- meaning is delusion - happiness is synchronizing personal delusion with those around you
- liberalism - glorifies subjectivity, voters know best, be true to yourself

## Future
- in past no intelligent design because no intelligence to design it
- is selective breeding really not natural selection? everything that persists is?
- nature?
- capacity for genetic engineering outpaces ability to make smart decisions
- how would genetic enhancement impact society - the rich could actually make themselves smarter and stronger, is everyone entitled to genetic enhancement like they are healthcare?
- approaching a new singularity where everything we know/believe now will be irrelevant with creation of new beings
- **what we expect doesn't happen, what happens we cannot expect**
- transformations so fundamental in human consciousness that what it means to be humans will change
- **ask ourselves what do we want to become?** everything we take for granted now will be gone, what do we want to stay?
- **what do we want to want?**

## The animal that became a god
- mastered surroundings by increasing suffering in the world, less wellbeing for humans and other animals
- what are our goals? we have advanced but aren't sure where to go? what is it for? 
- **we are disatisfied and irresponsible gods that don't know what they want**
