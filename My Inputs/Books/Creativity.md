## Summary
### Context
- This is a collection of writings edited by P.E. Vernon on creativity from psychologists and other creative professionals published in 1970 ranging from empirical studies, subjective accounts and development and growth of the skill. Some are dense, some are fascinating and I’m sure some are out of date, but it gives an expansive introduction to the investigation of creativity as a simultaneously innate and experience-dependent trait.
### Main Takeaways
-  Creativity is innate, but environmental factors determine if it is expressed.
- main predictor of success is not creativity or intelligence but willingness to work hard
- to be eminent you have to say no to normal things
- intelligence and knowledge can close mind, creativity opens mind
### Questions/Connections/Thoughts

## Notes
L.M Terman defines intelligence: ==“the sine qua non of genius is the ability to acquire and to manipulate concepts, the shorthand symbols without which abstract thinking cannot proceed.==” (p25). Does it have to be abstract?

==“The genius who survives as such has successfully run the gauntlet of premature death, the inanities of formal education, the social and ethical pressures of his immediate environment, and the more general cultural influences that have given direction and content to the civilization in which he was born.==” (p26)

Terman notes that IQ tests are not predictive of eminence, a finding from a study of 300 of the ‘most eminent individuals’ (selected from a list of Cattell’s 1000) by Catharine Cox. In her study, Cox examined the biographies of the individuals to deduce the minimum IQ of each individual, and the reliability of the estimate. Terman explains Cox’s conclusion that ==“those who do achieve greatly are characterized not only by superior intellectual ability but also ‘by persistence of motive and effort, confidence in their abilities and great strength or force of character.’==” (p29) Effort is giftedness.

Terman also relays German psychologist Lange-Eichbaum’s theory that ==“inner conflicts and tensions of whatever kind [are] stimulants to great achievement.==” and that ==“without such irritants no one ever puts forth his maximum effort; that the person happily adjusted to its environment and never stirred to action by opposition or frustration is fordoomed to obscurity.==” (p34)

From an excerpt of a letter composed by Tchaikovsky: ==“if that condition of mind and soul, which we call inspiration, lasted long without intermission, no artist could survive it.==” (p58). The nature of being an artist is a manic swing from exclusively absorbing the world to essentially ignoring it in favour of creative production.

Poet Stephen Spender explains the need for a steady stimulus to stay concentrated when working creatively, giving the example of De la Mare needed to chainsmoke, or Schiller and the smell of rotten apples. He explains, ==“there is always a slight tendency of the body go sabotage the attention of the mind by providing some distraction. If this need for distraction can be directed into one channel - such as the odor of rotten apples or the taste of tobacco or tea - then other distractions outside oneself are put out of competition.==” (p63). This is an interesting explanation for why I like listening to ASMR while working on assignments. One assumes the clear desk in the room without interruptions is where most work will get done, but in reality this allows the mind to wander freely. A steady stimulus keeps the distractions distracted.

Spender also asserts ==“it is evident that a faith in their vocation, mystical in intensity, sustains poets.==” (p73). This applies equally to songwriting. Every time I write a new song I feel like I’ve caught something, or channeled it for an hour and then it’s let out into the creative product until I can trap it again.

Spender notes that eminent creatives sacrifice ‘normal’ aspects of life for the time and energy to sustain creative production. He notes ==“a man of action does one thing or several things because he does not do something else. Usually men who do very spectacular things fail completely to do the ordinary things which fill the lives of most normal people and which would be far more heroic and spectacular perhaps if they did not happen to be done by so many people.==” He ends this passage with a heartbreakingly relatable sentiment: ==“thus in practice the life of action has always seemed to me an act of cutting oneself off from life. (p73). But you don’t have a choice, do you?

Poincaré in a discussion of mathematical creativity explains that new ideas and realizations require an initial amount of familiarization with the problem and solution attempts, and then a break to allow the unconscious mind to continue considering alternatives. He notes ==“all the combinations would be formed in consequence of the automatism of the subliminal self, but only the interesting ones would break into the domain of consciousness.==” (p85).  He compares this to physical stimuli in which ==“only the most intense fix our attention==” especially those which ==“directly or indirectly, affect most profoundly our emotional sensibility.==” (p85). We are kind of like computers running every possible option, but slower and fuzzier, and we only notice when it makes us feel something.

German physicist Helmholtz used a stage model to explain the creative process, consisting of Preparation, where ==“the problem is investigated in all directions,==” (p91) Incubation, where one is ==“not consciously thinking about the problem,==” (p91) and Illumination, when what G. Wallas calls the ==“happy idea==” (p92) appears. Wallas adds the fourth stage of Verification, where the idea is validated as relevant and accurate.

Wallas mentions the importance of education ==“men have known for thousands of years that conscious effort and its resulting habits can be used to improve the thought processes of young persons, and have formulated for that purpose an elaborate art of education. The ‘educated’ man can, in consequence, ‘put his mind on’ to a chosen subject, and ‘turn his mind off’ in a way which is impossible to an uneducated man. The educated man has also acquired, by the effort of observation and memorizing, a body of remembered facts and words which gives him a wider range in the final moment of association, as well as a number of those habitual tracks of association which constitute ‘thought systems.’ (p92-93). Is intelligence just mental control? How can we have none of this innately, when education was at one point developed by uneducated people? Passing on knowledge to the next generation evolved into formalized education and the mind molded around it until that became part of being human.

Wallas mentions that to produce quality results, one must engage early in the Preparation phase, to ensure there is enough Incubation time. He gives the example of ==“practicing barristers [putting] off any consideration of each brief to the latest possible moment before they have to deal with it, and [forgetting] the whole matter as rapidly as possible after dealing with it. This fact may help to explain a certain want of depth which has often been noticed in the typical lawyer-statesman, and which may be due to his conscious thought not being sufficiently extended and enriched by subconscious thought.==” (p94). Consciousness isn’t enough to be insightful.

Wallas cites WIlliam James’ assertion that ==“when the conclusion is there, we have always forgotten most of the steps preceding its attainment==” (p97) in his discussion of why the creative process remains nebulous at best. 

F. C. Bartlett, in an examination of scientific experimentation and creativity, explains that ==“the most important feature of original experimental thinking is the discovery of overlap where formerly only isolation and difference were recognized.==” (p101). I think this is where intelligence comes from.

Bartlett goes on to explain that ==“especially in the early stages of specific experimental progress, some of the most important thinking of the experimental scientists concerns the pinpointing, of siting, of problems; this may do more than anything else to save the experimenter from losing himself in detail.==” (p104). This feels relevant to design too, as most things do to me. You can’t know when you’ve created something of value without a deep understanding of the missing link you are trying to connect. And is it even a link at all, or a separate chain entirely?

E. W. Sinnott claims that humans have transcended other animals, as evidenced by the fact that ==“most of his goals are now fulfilled not by bodily actions, but by mental ones.==” (p107). Essentially, we’ve transcended literal reality, and live in abstraction now. In parallel, one’s inner environment changes to reflect the increasing complexity of modern life, and one’s outer environment becomes evermore complex as a result.

Sinnott claims that the ability to learn alone is not enough to ==“make him truly man. Another gift was necessary - the great gift of imagination. This is perhaps man’s most distinctive trait, for it makes possible his creativeness.==” (p108). 

Poet A. E. Housman describes the creative impulses experienced in between mundane life as follows. ==“As I went along, thinking of nothing in particular, only looking at things around me and following the progress of the seasons, there would flow into my mind, with sudden and unaccountable emotion, sometimes a line or two of verse, sometimes a whole stanza at once, accompanied, not preceded, by a vague notion of the poem which they were destined to form part of. Then there would usually be a lull of an hour or so, the perhaps the spring would bubble up again.==” (p109). This is exactly how songwriting is, lyrics just arrive and you take the ride or you let them pass. Interesting that this also alludes to the incubation phase but between bouts of creative ideation. Do we owe creativity to the unconscious? Or maybe the awareness that there is an unconscious is what makes us uniquely creative.

Sinnott describes artists; ==“it has been found among all sorts of men and women who are faced with the need - sometimes the consuming, passionate desire - to gain a new insight into truth or beauty, to solve a problem in science, to bring to life a painting out of pigment, oil and canvas, or to set a poem down in words. Such inspirations, it is well recognized, rarely come unless an individual has immersed himself in a subject.==” (p110). If expertise is a prerequisite for creativity, then generative AI will likely not make us ‘more creative’ as optimists say, as we will lose grasp on the hard skills of executing creative concepts. Expertise is a knowledge of what is possible, and what potential can be pursued, but is it foundational to creativity? Can you truly be ‘creative’ if you do not understand what has come before?

Sinnott describes how fully conscious, intentional acts of creativity are often extremely difficult and of poorer quality than ‘organic’ creative formations. He notes ==“the reason that such a frontal attack often fails seems to be that the free association, present in the unconscious, is blocked in various ways and the really creative new relationships therefore are not seen.==” (p112). We inhibit ourselves with the schema we have created to understand.

Sinnot suggests that creativity is an inevitable byproduct of being a conscious human, calling it an ==“attribute of life.==” (p112). He goes on to explain that ==“mind has a truly morphogenetic quality about it.==” (p112), implying that we cannot help but to make new connections. The unconscious mind yearns to understand and to express, which manifests through creative production that the conscious mind can harness and execute. Sinnott closes with the strong statement ==“[[Imagination, we might say, is simply the basic formative quality of life]].==” (p114). 

A. J. Cropley, in an examination of stimulus-response (S-R) theories of creativity, cites Mednick’s theory that creativity is ==“the formation of associations between stimuli and responses which are characterized by the fact that the elements linked together are not normally associated. Thus, he suggests that divergent people tend  to link stimuli  with highly unlikely responses, whereas in most people any particular stimulus is usually linked with the response with which it has most frequently been paired. In other words, highly divergent people are particularly skillful at linking together, in an effective way, aspects of their environment which, on the basis of experience, do not really belong together.==” (p117). So creativity is finding new combinations that belong together.

Cropley also mentions that creativity may be a function of instrumental condition, wherein rewarded responses are repeated and neutral responses are not. He notes ==“the extent to which a child is able to make creative responses will be heavily dependent on the extent to which he has been rewarded or punished for creative thinking during his past childhood.==” (p118). It’s kind of scary how most of the dimensions of the self are largely experience-dependent. I wonder if rewarding creativity is enough to increase thoughtful creativeness, or just fosters disruptive and attention-seeking ‘creativity’ that is more of a refusal to conform than a desire to expand.

Cropley explains that creative people have a differing cognitive approach (he calls it a ==“mind style==” (p119)  or ==“cognitive style==” (p122)), in that they take in more information from their environment, ==“rather than restricting themselves to a narrow, but safe, segment of it.==” (p119). This is an underrated truth: creativity requires fuel. In isolation I don’t think you can be creative, you need to take in the ambiguous mess of external stimuli in order to create order and meaning out of it. Allowing oneself to experience ambiguity is a hurdle that prevents a lot of people from being creative. Too many people stop themself before they even start. Cropley suggests further that there are two general cognitive styles, one to selectively focus on a few elements of the environment, and one to take in the world ==“in large lumps==” (p122), and that creative thinkers are usually those whose cognitive style ==“involves the least censoring of information.==” (p123). 

Cropley explains Bruner’s view of intelligence as data coding by linking novel stimuli to past experiences in order to create a continuous thread of meaning. He explains ==“any individual in contact with the external world is confronted with masses of data, too much, in fact, for him to handle. If he tries to take in everything, he suffers a great deal of ‘cognitive strain.’ What happens is that individual environmental events are tied to previous events so that new data are seen, not as unique occurrences, but as part of a related sequence of events which the environment has been providing throughout life. Thus, a new datum is rendered ‘meaningful’ by being connected with past data which it resembles… The point is that the external world is rendered meaningful by the linking of new events with past events which they resemble, and Bruner sees this as the chief kind of intellectual activity.==” (p120). The categories within which we classify events are based on experience, so are generally shared within cultures, yet some people classify in atypical ways, which we call creative thinking. This involves ==“willingness to treat data whose connexion is not immediately apparent as roughly equivalent==” (p121), essentially embracing ambiguity until connection can be inferred or imposed with novel categories.

==“The creative thinker is not afraid to take a risk with his ideas… Creative people are willing to ‘have a go.’ intellectually speaking. They will, for example, risk an intelligent guess in a problem situation, whereas convergent thinkers are much more inclined to report that the problem is simply insoluble when it becomes apparent that logic, rule, and principle will not provide a solution. The latter kind of thinkers may even refuse to go on, on the grounds that the situation is ‘foolish.’==” (p123). All of our limits are made up.

Freud equates childhood play to creative production when he says ==“the opposite of play is not what is serious but what is real.==” and goes on to explain ==“the creative writer does the same as the child at play. He creates a world of phantasy which he takes very seriously.==” (p127). 

Freud explains that people stop playing as they mature, but they continue to yearn for the pleasure of play, as ==“hardly anything is harder for a man than to give up a pleasure which he has once experienced. Actually, we can never give anything up; we only exchange one thing for another.==” (p128). I guess this is why we cannot solve climate change.

Freud claims that adults all secretly engage in fantasies of an ideal future using the conditions of the present and experience of the past, stating ==“the wish makes use of an occasion in the present to construct, on the pattern of the past, a picture of the future.==” (p130). 

Freud explains the comfort of following a fictional heroic character with the comfort that they are invincible, stating ==“as one of our best writers has expressed in an inimitable phrase: ‘Nothing can happen to me!’ It seems to me, however, that through this revealing characteristic of invulnerability we can immediately recognize His Majesty the Ego, the hero alike of every day-dream and of every story.==” (p132). ‘everybody wants to fall in love, everybody wants to play the lead’

Freud views the process of creative production as an expression of past and present experiences. He suggests ==“a strong experience in the present awakens in the creative writer a memory of an earlier experience (usually belonging to his childhood) from which there now proceeds a wish which finds its fulfillment in the creative work. The work itself exhibits elements of the recent provoking occasion as well as of the old memory.==” (p133).

Previously, Freud mentioned how everyone has fantasies, yet we keep them hidden in shame. He expands on this, claiming that for creatives ==“the essential ars poetica lies in the technique of overcoming this feeling of repulsion in us which is undoubtedly connected with the barriers that rise between each single ego and the others.==” (p134). This is an underrated reality of being an artist: it feels kind of gross and self-indulgent a lot of the time. This is why I don’t paint anymore, because why? Why in a world of visual pollution would anyone need another visual artifact? It’s a shameful paralysis. I keep making creative work of some capacity because despite how icky it makes me feel at times, and how much I am well aware the world does not need it, I have no choice.

==“The artist is an incipient introvert who is not far from being neurotic. He is impelled by too powerful instinctive needs. He wants to achieve honour, power, riches, fame, and the love of women, But he lacks the means of achieving these satisfactions. So unlike any other unsatisfied person, he turns away from reality, and transfers all his interests, his libido, too, to the elaboration of his imaginary wishes, all of which might easily point the way to neurosis.==” (Freud, obviously, p135). Me with university.

C. R. Rogers explains the need for creativity in a society that all but demands conformity, ==“with scientific discovery and invention proceeding, we are told, at a geometric rate of progression, a generally passive and culture-bound people cannot cope with the multiplying issues and problems. Unless individualis, groups and nations can imagine, construct and creatively revise new ways of relating to these complex changes, the lights will go out. Unless man can make new and original adaptations to his environment as rapidly as his science can change the environment, our culture will perish. Not only individual maladjustment and group tensions but international annihilation will be the price we pay for lack of creativity.==” (p138). And now AI is speeding up everything more to the point that humans may genuinely be left in the dust of computers. Perhaps we will be slaves to the hardware as the algorithms go and have all the fun. Is there a reason we did this? Why is faster always better? Did we not make up the world as it is in its current state? Why do we insist on making life harder for ourselves when a fundamental tenet of humanity is we struggle with change? Are there limits to our cognitive capacity worth respecting for the preservation of wellbeing? When the machine gets too big it starts ripping itself apart. 

Rogers fuels my obsession with productivity ==“though my fantasies may be extremely novel, they cannot usefully be defined as creative unless they eventuate in some observable product.==” (p138). 

Rogers redeems himself with a very inclusive view of creativity, ==“the action of the child inventing a new game with his playmates; Einstein formulating a theory of relativity; the housewife devising a new sauce for the meat; a young author writing his first novel – all of these are, in terms of our definition, creative, and there is no attempt to set them in some order of more or less creative.==” (p140). 

==“The mainspring of creativity appears to be the same tendency which we discover so deeply as the curative force in psycho-therapy – man’s tendency to actualize himself, to become his potentialities.==” (Rogers, p140). I want it so bad but you can never achieve your potential.

==“The genuinely significant creation, whether an idea, or a work of art, or a scientific discovery, is most likely to be seen at first as erroneous, bad or foolish. Later it may be seen as obvious, something self-evident to all. Only still later does it receive its final evaluation as a creative contribution.==” (Rogers, p141). 

==“It has been found that when the individual is ‘open’ to all of his experiences, then his behaviour will be creative, and his creativity may be trusted to be essentially constructive… To the extent that the individual is denying to awareness (or repressing, if you prefer that term) large areas of his experience, then his creative formings may be pathological or socially evil, or both==” (Rogers, p141).

==“When man is less than fully man – when he denies to awareness various aspects of his experience – then indeed we have all too often reason to fear him and his behaviour, as the present world situation testifies. But when he is most fully man, when he is his complete organism, when awareness of experience, that peculiarly human attribute, is most fully operating, then he is to be trusted, then his behaviour is constructive. It is not always conventional, It will not always be conforming. It will be individualized. But it will also be socialized.==” (Rogers, p142). 

Rogers explains that experiencing one’s surroundings without distorting them into categories from perception is an important prerequisite to creativity. He elaborates, ==“instead of perceiving in predetermined categories (trees are green; college education is good; modern art is silly) the individual is aware of this existential moment as it is, this being alive to many experiences which fall outside the usual categories (this tree is lavender; this college education is damaging; this modern sculpture has a powerful effect on me).==” He reaffirms ==“the complete openness of awareness to what exists at this moment is, I believe, an important condition of constructive creativity.==” (p143). I think we all forgot to experience our life. I wonder if meditation makes you more creative? It seems like practice being completely open.

==“I do not believe that many significant creative products are formed without the feeling, ‘I am alone. No one has ever done just this before. I have ventured into territory where no one has been. Perhaps I am foolish, or wrong, or lost, or abnormal.’==” (Rogers, p146). Does creativity necessitate misery? I never write songs when I’m happy.

J.P. Guilford, in examining societal interest in creativity, explains ==“boredom has also been a creeping disease in modern industry, where men and women need to perform less and less like human beings. Their work no longer calls upon them, as formerly, for decisions and constructive thinking. The advances in automation have not helped the situation. There is also boredom arising from increased leisure time. Fortunately, satiation with any condition usually leads to corrective measures. The best solution would seem to direct leisure-time activities into channels of creative effort, giving individuals  a taste of the rewards that can come from such efforts.==” (p168).  Freeing up all of our time to do what? Feel like we have no skills, no purpose and no contribution? Now we have to carefully engage in ‘leisure creativity’ to gain some semblance of actualization.

Guildford explains that in studies of eminent creative individuals, high levels of creativity were not actually predictive. He notes Anne Roe’s study of leading artists and scientists, and her finding that there was ==“only one trait that stood out in common among individuals. This was a willingness to work hard and to work long hours.==” (p175). Success is discipline.

==“Most of the aptitude factors identifiable as belonging in the category of creativity are classifiable in a group of divergent-thinking abilities. These abilities, by contrast to convergent-thinking abilities, emphasize searching activities with freedom to do in different directions, if not a necessity to do so in order to achieve an excellent performance. Convergent-thinking activities proceed toward one right answer, or one that is more or less clearly demanded by the given information.==” (p186). Just like lateral versus linear design thinking. To get the good ideas you need to allow them space to be seen.

J.W. Getzels and P.W. Jackson in a review of the creative student in the education system explain that creative students generally scored lower on standardized tests of IQ, but has similar scholastic achievement to high IQ students, making them ‘overachievers.’ They note ==“it is assumed that the motivational elements pushing the student to outdo himself, as it were, are linked in varying degree to pathological conditions.==” (p194). 

Getzels and Jackson found in a survey of teachers that high IQ students are vastly preferred over highly creative students, despite their equivalent academic achievement (p194). Creative students are disruptive and bothersome because they don’t just eat the slop.

Getzels and Jackson conclude that ==“high IQs tend to converge upon stereotyped meanings, to perceive personal success by conventional standards, to move toward the model provided by teachers, to seek out careers that conform to what is expected of them. The high creatives tend to diverge from stereotyped meanings, to produce original fantasies, to perceive personal success by unconventional standards, to seek out careers that do not conform to what is expected of them.==” (p202). I feel like an imposter in both groups. 

C. L. Blunt discusses a study of high school students and creativity, in which creative students were found to be higher achievers than students of higher IQ, and more playful, witty and ==“liable to ‘break away from the stimulus,’ using it chiefly as a point fo departure for free self expression.==” (p206). The world is a prompt, not an end.

Blunt notes the differences in parental occupation and education between high IQ and highly creative groups: ==“most of the fathers and more than half the mothers in the ‘intelligent’ group has received a ‘graduate training’: in more than 60 per cent of the cases the fathers’ occupational status is described as ‘university teaching, researching or editing.’ Among the ‘creative’ group, about 50 per cent of the fathers appear to have been engaged in ‘business’ – nearly three times as many as the ‘intelligent’ group. The parents of the ‘intelligent’ group exercised greater ‘critical vigilance’ in regard to their children’s day-to-day life.==” (p207). Is business the only place creativity has left to live?

==“Mere creativity without intelligence, as Galton long ago pointed out, would be all but worthless.==” (Blunt, p211).

==“That a state of scholastic divorce from reality should be superseded by one of hectic freedom is surely to be applauded.==” [L. Hudson on the downfall of the IQ test] (p219).

Hudson explains MacKinnon’s study on adult IQ and achievement, between which, beyond the threshold of about 120 IQ, there is no relationship. He elaborates ==“above a certain required minimum level of intelligence, which varies from field to field and in some instances may be surprisingly low, being more intelligent does not guarantee a corresponding increase in creativeness.==” (p221). He later asserts ==“above a certain level of I.Q., motivation is of over-riding importance.==” (p223) and cites Cox’s remark ==“high but not the highest intelligence, combines with the greatest degree of persistence, will achieve greater eminence than the highest degree of intelligence with somewhat less persistence.==” (p226).

Hudson, in his chapter, explains the results of a survey of eminent individuals with a variety of creative careers (psychologists, novelists, physical scientists etc…). He explains that assessing high-performing individuals, especially in sciences, with standardized IQ tests is pointless because their skills greatly exceed those that the test expects or demands. He notes that the complex skills of a scientist are ==“not beyond us simply because they are too complex. They depend, firstly, on huge accumulations of experience; and secondly, upon the fact that the individual concerned cares intensely about what he is doing. Without training and experience, these complex skills do not exist.==” (p226). What is intelligence if such complex and seemingly unattainable skills can be learned? IQ tests are more a measure of the public school system or one’s enrichment experiences than the actual intelligence they possess, because there is nothing tangible to examine. The brain is plastic, and its neurons are always changing depending on what we do and don’t do. To think we are ever static is a myth. Therefore, is intelligence a worthwhile ‘metric’ to measure? Isn’t the true asset motivation? From motivation comes all other desirable traits.

==“Of the physical scientist, the very worst that one can say is that he is a robot: he turns his back on a wide range of human experience more or less completely. Of the novelist, that he is an emotional prostitute, a man retailing the events of his own private life to please his public, or for money. The psychologist, on the other hand, does something considerably more odd: he tries to make sense of human behaviour by reifying it. People are described as though they are mechanisms; their experiences are reduced to numbers. He may even make a virtue of discussing humans as if they were rats. The physical scientist denies his emotions; the novelist exploits; the psychologist dismantles. Whatever the moral, it is not that some occupational groups are more neurotic than others.==” (p230). I love everything about this passage.
 
Hudson cites Roe’s finding that ==“it is likely that the kind of person who has gone into social science may have had a biasing effect on the theories produced by social scientists… Practically all current psychological theory of development stresses strongly the central importance in any life of the richness of personal relations as the basis for ‘adjustment.’ But the data of this study demonstrate, and it seems to me quite conclusively, that a more than adequate personal and social adjustment in the larger sense of an adjustment which permits a socially extremely useful life and one that is personally deeply satisfying, is not only possible, but probably quite common, with little of the sort of personal relations which psychologists consider essential. Many of the biological and physical scientists are very little concerned with personal relations, and this is not only entirely satisfactory to them, but it cannot be shown always to be a compensatory mechanism.==” (p230). I cannot believe I never considered how biased all the scientific information we consider fact is by those that are drawn to the field. If all the people deeply concerned with human behaviour and connection become psychologists, then that becomes what is true of all humans. Literally nothing is true then.

==“If we adjust children to themselves and each other, we may remove them from the springs of their intellectual and artistic productivity. Happy children simply may not be prepared to make the effort which excellence demands.==” (p232). Contentment is stagnation. Is it better to be content and not living up to your potential, or miserable but actualized? Can you be content if you aren’t actualized? 

M. A. Wallach and N. Kogan explain that creativity requires ==“the production of associative content that id abundant and that is unique==” and ==“the presence in the associator of a playful, permissive task attitude.==” (p238). 

Wallach and Kogan found in a study of school-aged children’s creativity in relation to other personality traits, that girls high in creativity and intelligence ==“show the least doubt and hesitation in all the groups, show the highest level of self-confidence, and display the least tendency toward depreciation of oneself and one’s work… These girls are sought out by their peers more eagerly than is any other group, and this high intelligence, high creativity group also seeks the companionship of others more actively than does any other group.==” (p244). It’s good to be on top. In contrast, the high intelligence, low creativity group was more insecure and anxious, in that they are ==“so attuned to error that even where appropriate responses are not sacrificed, they refuse to deviate from a critical standard of ‘correctness.’==” (p251). 

High creativity and intelligence children are also more sensitive, and Wallach and Kogan theorize, ==“the creativity and intelligence both could contribute to such physiognomic sensitivity – responsiveness to ‘inner’ feeling states on the basis of perceivable externals – suggested that two processes could be jointly involved in the display of sensitivity.==” (p252). I wonder if HSPs are more creative or if sensitivity, meaning one is more aware of their surroundings, leads to more creativity? What is the direction of causation here?

==“It is unrealistic to assume that the most creative children are the happiest children. There may well be elements of obsessiveness present in the kind of associative freedom that leads to high creativity status. A playful contemplation of the possible, but also an obsessive, task-centered reluctance to put a problem aside may be involved in the production of many associates and of a large number of unique associates. Creativity need not be all sweetness and light, therefore, but may well involve a tolerance for and understanding of sadness and pain. To think otherwise is to fall prey to the rather widespread American stereotype that suffering is always a bad thing and to be avoided at all costs.==” (p253).

R. J. Shapiro cites Bruner’s definition of creativity, ‘an act that produced effective surprise – this I shall take as the hallmark of a creative enterprise.’ and McPherson’s analysis of this, ==“The effective surprise is not produced because a product is rare of bizarre, but because it has a quality of obviousness which results in a shock of recognition.==” (p261). This is also a definition of good design.

F. Barron explains that organizations and societies foster creativity when they are less prescriptive and controlling of citizens, comparing totalitarian states to neurotic individuals. He explains, ==“suppression is a common way of achieving unity, however, because in the short run it often seems to work. Increasing complexity puts a strain upon the organism’s ability to integrate phenomena; one solution of the difficulty is to inhibit the level of a greater level of complexity, and thus to avoid the temporary disintegration that would otherwise have resulted. Originality, then, flourishes when suppression is at a minimum.==” (p286). 

Barron suggests one of the requisite traits for creativity is ‘dominance,’ or ==“a strong need for personal mastery, not merely over other persons, but over all of experience.==” (p287). Creativity is ordering chaos in newly obvious ways.

==“The original person, in adulthood, thus often like things messy, at least at first; the tendency is toward a final order, but the necessary preliminary is as big a mess as possible.==” (p287). This is exactly EXACTLY the design process. I do not understand designers that use autolayout from the start and delete all their drafts. When I start designing, my entire goal is to create chaos, because from there the ideas emerge. Yes, at the end it will be pixel perfect, but anyone can do that. The ideation process is what we, as designers, have to offer.

==“[Creatives] are characteristically aroused to wrath at the shoddy, the meretricious, and the unjust, and their feelings about creative power in themselves and others is in some sense religious. Very often their work, seen in the perspective of a lifetime of endeavor, is itself the creation of a cosmos of their own, as though each mind is progressively unfolding itself as life itself has.==” (Barron, p288). This is a stunningly beautiful passage that I resonate with a lot. Creativity is the pursuit of a new world.

MacKinnon explains the results from a study of architects in relation to creativity, noting that the most creative architects ==“appear to have both a strong need and superior capacity to achieve the most difficult and far-reaching ordering of the richness they are willing to experience.==” (p303).

Of highly creative architects MacKinnon mentions ==“in general, their attitude in college appears to have been one of profound skepticism.==” (p305).

MacKinnon notes that the creative architects had more ==“openness to his own feelings and emotions, a sensitive intellect and understanding self-awareness, and wide-ranging interests including many which in the American culture are thought of as feminine. In the realm of sexual identifications and interests, out creative subjects appear to give more expression to the feminine side of their nature than do less creative persons.==” (p306).

R. B. Cattell and H. J. Butcher share the findings from a study of eminent scientists in relation to creativity, in which they found the creative scientists has ==“uncongenial and ‘undemocratic’ attitudes, associated with dominance… accounting to a belief that most people are rather stupid.==” (p315).

Cattell and Butcher found that creative scientists were all low on extraversion scores, using Broadbent’s information to brain action theory that ==“as long as you use a lot of the [sensory] channels for input, you have too few free channels for scanning… The typical extravert conceivably has too many channels taking in information – or at least, alert to the external trivia of everyday life – and not enough for scanning accepted material. Or to quote Wordsworth instead of information theory: ‘The world is too much with us.’ And if we paraphrase the next line,: ‘Talking and visiting, we lay waste to our powers.’==” (p319). Balancing the innate need for social interaction with the burning desire to personally achieve is a challenge for sure. Every second I spend socializing I am wasting time I could be spending producing. On the other hand, spending my life in pursuit of achievement and nothing else (as I had for the past 3 years) led to the most vacuous feeling of emptiness I’d ever experienced. I think you need both to make life worth living.

==“It would almost seem as if the differences between science, art and literature are differences of particular skill and interests only and that the fundamental characteristic of the creative, original person is a type of personality.==” (Cattell and Butcher, p323). Going beyond design is one, creativity is one.

S. J. Parnes cites Guilford to explain how creativity is not a fixed metric, but an experience-dependent and flexible trait (like everything else) ==“creative activity probably represents to some extent many learned skills. There may be limitations set on these skills by heredity; but I am convinced that through learning one can extend the skills beyond those limitations.==” (p434). 

Parnes describes a university course on creativity in which students are taught ==“deferred judgment==” which is ==“deliberate separation of idea production from evaluation. In other words, during the effort to generate ideas, the judicial process is deliberately suspended; evaluation is deferred in order to allow full play to imagination.==” (p344). Hey it’s Enzo Mari’s railway model of design. In order to create anything of use and novelty one must allow the ‘poetics’ to breathe instead of forcing a concept into pragmatic practice too soon. He mentions an exercise in which students are taught to consider unconventional uses for everyday objects to increase ideational fluency. Parnes elaborates, ==“for example, in considering other uses for such an object as a piece of paper, students are taught to look at each attribute of the paper – its whiteness, its four corners, its straight edges, etc. Each of these attributes suggests a number of possible uses.==” (p345). This is a good brainstorming exercise.

In the course, students are also taught to solve problems in terms of asking questions. Parnes emphasizes three key points stressed in the course: ==“the importance of taking notes,==” ==“the value of setting deadlines and quotas for production of ideas and the advantage of setting aside certain times and places for deliberate idea production.==” (p345). 

Parnes explains that throughout the course, the principle of deferred judgment is practiced through problem solving. Students are encouraged to first analyze, in which they list every fact they have relating to the problem, then choose the most relevant to focus on. The students ==“create the longest possible list of questions and sources of additional data that could be useful==” and select from these the most useful again. To evaluate their options, ==“students are taught to develop the longest possible list of criteria by which to evaluate their tentative solutions==” and from these, you guessed it, they choose the most relevant to compare against. The course was shown to facilitate a lasting increase in creativity (p346). Parnes notes Osborn’s theory that ==“in idea production, quality leads to quality.==” and Gordon’s idea of ‘deferment’ as ==“the capacity to discard the glittering immediate in favor of a shadowy but possibly richer future.==” (p349). Creativity is really about freeing yourself from the expectation of getting it right the first time. It is letting yourself try and be imperfect. It is letting out the ready-made concepts to make room for the truly novel to emerge. It is magic. It cannot be rushed.

Parnes notes Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, atop of which is the need for self actualization, the prime motivation of a healthy individual (Maslow views not having a tier of needs met as being ‘sick’). Parnes cites Maslow ==“what a man can be, he must be.==” (Maslow, p351). Yes. If there’s potential I have to reach it. I owe it to the universe.

==“The individual’s creative ability is frequently so repressed by his education and experience that he cannot even recognize his full potential, let alone realize it. Once he can be helped to do so, he can reach what Maslow calls ‘self-actualization.’ Education can do much to help the individual achieve this fullest self-realization, whatever his level of native capacity. Many people seem to possess the seeds of creativeness, but the environment fails to provide the proper nourishment for growth. Therefore, these persons never fully live.==” (p352). 

E.P. Torrance explains how creative talent ==“has not been valued and rewarded in our education system, so guidance workers have seem little reason to identify it and to try to contribute to its growth.==” (p356). What education values, society becomes.

Torrance further notes the importance of creative expression ==“the stifling of creativity cuts at the very roots of satisfaction with living and ultimately creates overwhelming tension and breakdown. There is little doubt that one’s creativity is his most valuable resource in coping with life’s daily stresses.==” (p356). Torrance continues, ==“I suspect that schizophrenics and others who ‘break down’ under stress constitute one of the most unimaginative, noncreative groups to be found. I also suspect that it was their lack of creativity rather than its presence which brought about their breakdowns.==” (p356-357). This kind of makes sense, creativity makes you flexible and resilient. If you are thwarted from reaching your goal do you adjust or do you crumble?

Torrance explains the inadequacy of IQ tests in identifying highly achieving students, ==“if we were to identify children as gifted on the basis of intelligence tests, we would eliminate from consideration approximately 70 per cent of the most creative. This percentage seems to hold fairly well no matter what educational level we study, from kindergarten through graduate school.==” (p358).

Torrance mentions that high IQ students are preferred by teachers over highly creative students, yet ==“the highly creative child appears to learn as much as the highly intelligent one, at least in some schools, without appearing to work as hard. My guess is that these highly creative children are learning and thinking when they appear to be ‘playing around.’... They enjoy learning and thinking, and this looks like play rather than work.==” (p359). Interesting that enjoying or having fun in school is looked down upon as something that needs to be stopped.

==“Instead of trying to cram a lot of facts into the minds of children and make them scientific encyclopedias, we must ask what kind of children they are becoming. What kind of thinking do they do? How resourceful are they? Are they becoming more responsible? Are they learning to give thoughtful explanations of the things they do and see? Do they believe their own ideas to be of value? Can they share ideas and opinions with others? Do they relate similar experiences together in order to draw conclusions? Do they do some thinking for themselves?==” (Torrance, p360).

Torrance cites Harvard psychologist Henry Murray, ==“An emotional deficiency disease, a paralysis of the creative imagination, an addiction to superficials – this is the diagnosis I would offer to account for the greater part of the widespread desperation of our time. Paralysis of the imagination, I suspect, would also account, in part, for the fact that the great majority of us, wedded to comfort as long as we both shall live, are turning our eyes away from the one thing we should be looking at: the possibility or probability of co-extermination.==” (p361).

Torrance notes that typically highly creative students are ==“estranged==” from teachers and peers alike, and to support them to flourish. He explains, ==“the highly creative child, adolescent or adult needs encouragement. He needs help in becoming reconciled and, as Hughes Mearns (1941) once wrote, in being ‘made cheerful over the world’s stubborn satisfaction in its own follies.’ The guidance worker must recognize, however, that this estrangement exists and that he will have to create a relationship in which the creative individuals feel safe.==” (p362). If creativity is allowing oneself to be open to all of experience, and not suppressing the aversive, is a necessary outcome being a bit sad about the world? Or a bit out of it? I feel like I’m floating out somewhere a lot of the time and occasionally social connection pulls me back to Earth.

==“A high degree of sensitivity, a capacity to be disturbed and divergent thinking are essentials of the creative personality. Frequently, creative children are puzzled by their own behaviour. They desperately need help in understanding themselves, particularly their divergence.==” (p364). 

Torrance stressed the importance of educational and home environments to foster creativity. He elaborates on the experience-dependence of creativity, ==“everyone possessed to some degree the ability involved in being creative, that these abilities can be increased or decreased by the way children are treated and that it is a legitimate function of the home and the school to provide the experiences and guidance which will free them to function fully.==” He then notes the adverse effects of the school system on destroying children’s confidence and ability to be creative, ==“I have seen many indications in out testing of first and second graders that many children with impoverished imaginations have been subjected to rather vigorous and stern efforts to eliminate fantasy too early. They are afraid to think.==” (p367). I think everybody is creative, and then the world beats it out of most people. Creativity is not just abstract and artsy, it allows us to solve problems, to adapt, to pick ourselves back up, to figure it out. Without creativity you are stuck, desperately searching for the one right answer. Creatives know there is no ‘answer’ and the world is multidimensional and complicated and overwhelming and beautiful. Creativity is confidence. Creativity is achieving yourself. I think the best thing you can do for someone is give them the space and support to be themself fully, or in other words, to be creative.
