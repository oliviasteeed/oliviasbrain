## Notes
- blaming external forces steals our power - [[You create your reality]]
> "The outer level is the sense that someone or something has harmed us, interfering with the harmony and peace we thought was ours." (p66)

- the stimulus is neutral, it is how we react that impacts us
> "As for the inner level of obstacle, nothing ever really attacks us except our own confusion. Perhaps there is no solid obstacle except our own need to protect ourselves from being touched." (p66)

- pursuit of distraction delays learning the necessary lesson from experience and letting it go
> "Maybe the only enemy is that we don't like the way reality is now and therefore with it would go away fast. But what we find as practitioners is [[Nothing ever goes away until it has taught us what we need to know]]" (p66)

- control is death because we are killing the moment by controlling our experience (p70)

- stop assuming life is supposed to be easy - makes you a victim. If it isn't hard you're not growing.
> "The essence of life is that it's challenging." (p71)

- looking for alternatives keeps us from taking pride in the sacred life we have (p129)
	- like in online dating or wishing life could be different without taking action -like [[Counterfactual thinking]] and [[Maladaptive daydreaming]] to avoid taking responsibility/acknowledging we are in control of our life

> "There is no alternative to the experience that we have. Our experience is the only experience there is." (p131)

- [[Reservations and lack of commitment prevent depth of experience]]
- [[Taking 100% responsibility is the first step to improving]]
> "We don't experience the world fully unless we are willing to give everything away. Samaya means not holding anything back, not preparing our escape route, not looking for alternatives, not thinking there is ample time to do things later." (p131)

- see what happens without trying to fix it, sometimes you have to let everything fall apart. (p138)

- instead of giving yourself a hard time take the harder/less traveled path of acceptance
> "Do we at least aspire to not consider ourselves a problem, but simply a pretty typical human being who could at that moment give themself a break and stop being so predictable?" (p141)
