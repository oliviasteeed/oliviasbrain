## Summary
### Context
- book by Micheal Pollan on "new science of psychedelics," relays personal and scientific perspective on psychedelics (psilocybin and LSD mainly) for expanding experience and overcoming mental health issues.
### Main Takeaways
- Psychedelics allow people to access direct consciousness, unmediated by preconceptions, like a child. In adulthood we do not actually see things, we just recognize and dismiss, psychedelics turn this off so everything is truly seen.
- There are different modalities/dimensions of consciousness, consciousness may be property 'out there' in universe that we tune in to instead of originating 'in here' - [[Consciousness is there, you just need to tune into it]]
- [[Default mode network]] makes you a self, separate from outside at cost of feelings of connectedness. Psychedelics suppress DFN and allow you to experience ego death and connection to life and universe, lose fear of death and counterfactual thinking
### Questions/Connections/Thoughts
- trying shrooms when?
## Notes
### introduction and history
- LSD was accidental invention, was supposed to stimulate blood flow - led to understanding of neurotransmitters and treating mental illnesses
- psilocybin mushrooms - "news of a new form of consciousness"
- best way to understand complex systems is disrupt it and see what happens
- his trip - wanted to be alone, undressed and as far from metal or plastic as possible
- set - mindset you bring
- setting - environment
- trips are always different because amplifies current emotion
- it is people in middle age who need a reminder of newness to bring meaning to middle age
- "experience an ego-free state" - lose fear of death
- LSD makes you experience world as child - as adult you don't perceive world directly, you make inferences based on previous understandings/expectations
- causes dissolution from self and merging with nature or universe
- the botany of desire book - universal human need to shift consciousness with psychoactive substances, tools for healing mind, communicating with spirit worlds, rites of passage, enrich collective imagination
- **"the efficiencies of the adult mind blind us to the present"** - use past experiences to perceive present, live in near future - psychedelics make you perceive everything
- William James - everyday consciousness is just one type of consciousness
- "the world as if newly created"Â 
- Aldous Huxley - doors of perception book
- "irrational exuberance"
- dissolution of barrier between self and worldÂ 
- **everything you do dedicate yourself to it completely**
- consciousness from universe
- on trip understand connections in universe - "compassion for the infancy/ignorance of science"
- psychedelic science gets shut down because it is threat to norms and capitalism/war motivation - also cause mk ultra against will control experiments
- expectation changes set and resulting trip, susceptible to priming effects
- in many cases most meaningful experiences of their lives
- "trying to hold on for dear life as they felt their body disintegrating"
- whenever you are afraid of something explore it
- **surrender to the experience no matter how afraid or uncomfortable**
- "ecstatic catastrophe of logic"
- indescribable, permanently transformed, understanding things you already know, passivity/surrender of will
- reality beneath reality
- longterm increase in openness to experience (big 5) - rare to lasting change personality of adults
- do not have words to express it, like aliens that come to earth and don't have vocabulary to express
- **if this is death so be it - phenomenology is so different, interested in ==savouring experience of death because will never know until you die==**
- **negative capability: ability to exist in uncertainty without duality or absolutes**Â 
- mushroom is fruiting body of fungus mycelia underground. like apple on apple tree
- mycelia link other plants into one bug network, have consciousness - can react to environment
- stoned ape theory: consciousness/critical thought/language (synthesthesia where sounds become associated with objects/meaning)/self reflection - born from mushroom trip
- everything is interaction and reciprocal
- dissolution of ego, not just seeing by schemas but seeing directly - everything is glowing/interesting
- helps people recover from alcoholism - similar to withdrawal hallucinations
- not delirium because pleasant
- issues were not with other people, but within me
- Al Hubbard - LSD clinical hub in vancouver?!
- LSD used in silicon valley - helped conceptualize and visualize complexity to make circuits, creativity to see potential and opportunities, transforming computers from top down tool of military industrial complex to counterculture tool of personal liberation and virtual communityÂ 
- cybernetics - material reality can be translated into bits of information
- LSD - critical ingredient of collaboration and acceptance of failure, permission to try shit out in silicon valley
- saw earth as round, realized it was finite
- study - 1/3 of each therapy and no therapy groups after a year are better, worse or same
- **normal consciousness is a drop in ocean of intelligence, consciousness exists outside of us and we tune in to dimensions of it**
- **plants/nature have consciousness and are trying to tell us things in a way we can understand**
- LSD in 1960s was new rite of passage for youth that older people didn't have. caused unprecedented generation gap
- too much politics and history that i don't really care about. not into history
- we live a very limited version of what life is
- surrender to fear - surrender to experience, there is nothing else - you might not get what you want, but you get what you need
- **breath work - big deep breaths, they start forced and then come naturally, surrender control of mind and body - ==the brain contains everything you need to get high, release yourself==**
- "fully inhabit my body"
- guide to hold space for you - so you don't have to worry about anything
- **brain filters/categorizes, only pay attention to new and ignore familiar - prevents us from being constantly overwhelmed by life. good to recontextualize and reinterpret familiar**
- hypnogogic (wake/sleep) and hypnopompic (sleep/wake) consciousness - between sleep and waking, surreal boundaries of reality
- the doors of perception book - Aldous Huxley
- afterglow after - more appreciative and accepting of present
- **==just give yourself up - suspend your disbelief, drop the act==**
- **perception is mostly guesswork with some environmental stimulus as cues**. traps us in preconceived notions of false reality. children/schizophrenics/people on psychedelics sense/perceive everything - no more schema/bias
- language fails description
- disembodied awareness - the mind at large (Aldous Huxley), consciousness outside of us and shareable to tune in, can let go of everything including ego - everything up to and including deathÂ  is accepted
- becoming indistinguishable from music/sound, experiencing music embodied
- **to make something make sense/into a story is to do it a sort of violence**
- cultivate mindset after with mindfulness/meditation - know it can exist, become selfless, egoless, connected, present
- **there is an infinite amount of time to be dead, do what you can in your life**
- don't be so extreme/limited - high openness
- **"every touchstone that tells us 'i exist' was annihilated"**
- everything in reality collapses backwards to nothing and then reverses and develops into matter and life and self - relief so vast to be, gratitude for being, for something rather than nothing
- **==being/doing duality, practice being not just running away by doing==**
- **it's an irrelevant question (if it's drug experience or actual truth), this is something being revealed to you**
- the universe as present
- spiritual - non religious ego death, merging
- all experience is chemicals, what's the difference?
### the neuroscience
- LSD fits in serotonin receptors better than serotonin
- default mode network is what makes us a self/ego - what comes on when we are mind wandering, what organizes and filters out world. too much mind wandering leads to decreased wellbeing but price willing to pay for selfhood, this is what makes us different than animals, we have a differentiated self. lens of consciousness to filter out entropy to make mind/world easier to manage. Â 
- under psychedelic experience less blood flow to default network - ego system is impaired, experience life without cognitive misery of perception using existing understandings and frameworks - perceive as is with more entropy and uncertainty tolerance - suddenly shifts attitudes and nature relatedness (no longer feel like differentiated self), usually have entropy filter for ease/speed of processing
- [[Entropy rigidity spectrum]] - ==**too much self awareness/reflection/rigidity leads to mental disorders==. default mode network as rigidity and structure, need turned off to have fun/be creative. excessive self awareness leads to depressions/eating disorders/addictions/compulsive behaviours.**Â 
- **brain activity is usually localized to separate networks that do not communicate a lot, on psychedelics brain activity is more distributed across many networks** - not just using normal brain parts to process their respective stimulus so new connections/experiences are formed (memory and sensation mixed)
- **==increasing entropy in brain is good thing==** - more creative. get less entropic with age because use past experiences to decide how to act - wisdom
- **==entropy is expansion==** - mindset on spectrum from contraction to expansionÂ 
- consciousness studied is focused on very narrow part of 'professor consciousness'
- adults spotlight/ego consciousness, child lantern consciousness experience surroundings in full, expansive, being inexperienced means no guides to sensation and perception
- ai - high temperature search: more creative and different, more time/energy to perform, low temperature search: most likely based on past, more safe
- child thinking not constrained by experience because test far fetched possibilities, better at learning. children lab rat for species, figure out how to manage in new worlds each generation
- pruning to suppress entropy in adolescence, consciousness narrows, action over exploration
- child/tripping: hot search, entropy, diffused attention, little sense of continuous self, magical thinking
- pathology - overly narrow consciousness becomes obsession/rigidity
- **==shaking the snowglobe==** - creativity
### death
- psychedelic therapy - bridging chemical/brain and soft/mind aspects of therapy
- shrooms to help existential distress (fear, depression and anxiety at terminal diagnosis/reminder or mortality) - longlasting change after only one dose - therapy by self transcendence, escape the ego/self and be one with world, become detached
- death - i do not invite it nor do i put it off
- **"even the germs, is there were any present, were beautiful, as was everything in our world and universe"**
- **orgasm of the soul**
- one note that everything in universe vibrates to. everything is overproduced, only thing that mattered is love
- dissolution of self and ego and it's okay
### addiction
- **addiction is extreme state of self centredness, psychedelics see broader connections/dissolution of self and ways it hurts others, ==addiction becomes irrelevant and unimportant in face of everything else**==
- better longterm outcomes than any treatment available
- rat park experiment: if rats are in boring cage will self administer drugs until starve to death, if in enriching cage will ignore it - drug addiction as direct response to environment
### depression
- depression as disconnection/overactive default mode network - feeling reconnected
- intellectually knowing there is beauty but not seeing it
- before i enjoyed nature, now i am part of it
- **==go in and through what could be difficult==**
- allows to feel difficult emotions
- a happy brain is a flexible brain - excessive order to excessive entropy spectrum of mental illness
- DFM also has time travel and autobiography capacities, ego/self defending from threats
- **ego death causes all the good parts of psychedelics** - spiritual, release, connectedness
### conclusion
- **matter doesn't exist unless perceived**
- a plant cannot be caged, only an animal can be caged
- everything has consciousness
