## Summary
### Context
- Productivity guide about using personal knowledge management to actualize creative projects by Tiago Forte
### Main Takeaways
- organize notes for use - goal is creativity
- centralized - no longer starting from blank page, starting from previous notes/thoughts
- don't live on autopilot and expect things to come together - effortless takes effort of continually honing systems
- don't settle for frustration of it could be better - do it
- production not perfection
### Questions/Connections/Thoughts
- 
## Notes
### Part 1: What are we doing here? The hard sell
- information overload has created a poverty of attention
- each technological change requires change in thinking
- commonplace book: reading/writing as continuous, nonlinear activity making your own book of concepts and life
- in real life, you don't know what to take notes on and can draw on them any time they are relevant - not just to memorize and forget. 
- note as knowledge building block
- creating value instead of killing time
- you can't fail because failure is just more information to learn from
- since nothing is truly final there is no need to wait - start now!
#### Purposes of Second Brain
- making ideas concrete
- revealing new associations between ideas
	- manipulating things is best way to find solutions/connections
- incubating our ideas over time
- sharpening out unique perspectives

- important jobs are promoting and supporting ideas - depend on ability to persuade
- ==writer's block means you don't have enough information/raw material to work with. ==if well has run dry you need more inputs
#### Stages of PKM
- remembering - facts and ideas
- connecting
- creating
#### [[CODE Method]]
- **Capture**: only what is noteworthy - what do you need? keep only what resonates, hits you on emotional level, turn up the volume on your intuition
- **Organize**: for action in projects you are working on right now, clear filter for ignoring irrelevant information, only keep what is necessary for your projects
- **Distill**: notice patterns between ideas, every note is seed of idea. distill notes down to their essence to make faster connections. =="how can I make this as useful as possible for my future self?"==
- **Express**: no point if you aren't making outputs, translate and apply knowledge into action, ==do not fall into trap of consumption safety==, information becomes knowledge after you put it to use, creating > consuming - spend as much time as possible creating, express to make an impact on what matters to you
### Capture
- curate information diet
- you are what you consume
- capture thoughts right as they appear - integrate note-taking in daily life
- creativity depends on creative process
- commonplace book - used for writing and discourse, songwriter - hook books
- keep a knowledge bank to draw upon for creativity, knowledge is everywhere
- **knowledge asset - solve problems, change worldview, create clarity (can be anything) - you have this, you just want to gather it up in knowledge garden, this produces more creativity to also write down and digest**
- write things down
- physical products - crystallized imagination, allowed to be shared with others
#### Favourite problems
- keep favourite problems in mind (12) - see everything you learn through this lens to test against
- insight doesn't need to be immediately actionable - just write it down and save it for it's time
- examples of favourite questions:
	- how do i live less in past and more in present? 
	- how do i switch from mindless consumption to mindful creation? 
	- how do i go to bed early? 
	- how can my industry become more sustainable? 
	- how do i start reading all the books i have instead of buying more? 
	- how can i made decisions with more confidence?Â 
- must be open ended - wonder and curiosity about world, stay relatively consistent over your life - what were you in wonder about as a child?
- how can creativity emerge out of chaos?Â 
- goal not to answer question but to use as guidance for your learning
- use problems to guide what you capture
#### Capture criteria
- **no more than 10%**
- inspiring, useful, personal ("no one else values the small moments of your days quite like you do"), surprising (contradiction > confirmation bias)Â 
- don't waste all energy on note making, it is foundation for more important
- emotions organize not disrupt rational thinking
- designing for behaviour change book
- trust and build your intuition

- second brain resource guide
- generation effect, thinking writing exchange
- detachment gain book
- **escape reactivity loop - decide what it means later**
- the creative habit book - ==box for each new project with name - committing to it, adding to it==
- ==start each project with goal, statement, intention==
- box is place to come back to whenever wanting to add to project
- cathedral effect - high ceiling think abstract, low ceiling thing concrete, environment impacts thinking
### Organize (for action)
- system needs to be organized for daily life - make minimal effort the default
- PARA method: project, area, resources, archives - encompass any kind if information based on how actionable it isÂ 
- **organizing is not an end in itself. ==organize for action==**
- project: start and end
- area: ongoing responsibility
- resource: things to reference in future
- archive: completed/no longer relevant
- needing clear space to create
- creating things is what matters
- move quickly touch lightly
- capture and organize separately
- organize for action
### Distill
- progressive summarization - cotinually highlight until crux (all notes, bold, highlight, executive summary from you in a few bullets at the top) - method for forgetting as much as possible, only remembering the most important
- every time you touch a note make it more discoverable
- do highlights when you have project to use it for
- ==when you're starting the project you want the research to already be done==
### Express
- collect, organize, distill, express
- **"we only know what me make"**
- **don't leave home without notebook, don't leave home without eyes and ears open, don't imagine what you could have, appreciate what you do**
- study dozens of topics, be a knowledge journalist
- Octavia Butler author in sci-fi
- ==**refusing to wait until you are perfectly ready to share what you know - share early and get feedback to add to knowledge**==
- reuse knowledge asset
- **intermediate packets - summaries, WIPs, templates from past projects, protocols (point not obscure), not starting from blank page**
- compose projects from previous IPs library
- create one IP each time you work and get feedback in bits instead of all at once
- ==[[Creativity thrives on examples]] - gives a framework==
- best ideas when concepts mixed across topics
#### Methods of retrieval: search, browse, tags, serendipity
- better at browsing than search - spatial thinking scaffolds abstract though
- "soup of creative DNA"
- share with others to expand ideas - curator and synthesizer of knowledge and opinions of networks
- remember, connect, create
- **value your ideas enough to share them**
- innovation and creativity takes strategy and structure to bring new inputs and insights to the surface
- **diverge converge balance in design thinking**
- just enough order
#### Creative strategies
- [[Archipelago of ideas]] (selection - diverge and sequencing - converge)
- [[Hemingway bridge]] - stop when you know what to do next, end with the beginning in mind (at end write current status, details, ideas, intention for next work session), share with someone else to get feedback for next time
- dial down scope - first to go are most difficult and uncertain, start with mvp, then build up on it
- ==don't wait to leave the driveway until all the traffic lights are green==
- nothing is lost - just saved for next project. this gives you the courage cut ruthlessly
- can't discover what people want until you create something
- **new project - just write, turn it into brief with sections - objectives, outcomes, phases, then share inspiration, resources, ideas**
- ==diverge outlandishly, then constrain scope and frame mvp==
#### Move fast and make things
- move all notes into project, only work with what you already have
- 15 minute first pass on project, after this relevant further resources will stand out
- "what is the smallest version of this i can produce to get valuable feedback from others?"
### Habits for digital organization
- fastÂ 
- mise en place - keep it clean and organized as you go, lay out what you need right away - externalize brain into environment and create systems
- all we do in consume and producing
- attention - asset that compounds over time
- everything we do is project
#### Project checklists - recycle knowledge, start and end checklists
- **[[Project start checklist]]:** capture current thinking brain dump - only 20-30 minutes, just to get idea of start
	- what do i know? 
	- what don't i know? 
	- what is my goal? 
	- who can i talk to? 
	- premortem?
	- what do i want to learn? 
	- define success criteria?
	- do a kickoff?
	- search for/browse related notes, add to project folder
- **being a curator about notes mean everything is the meat**
- **[[Project end checklist]]:** mark project as complete - no more than 10-15 minutes
	- review ips and move to other folders
	- reflect on intro checklist
	- mistakes? 
	- struggles? 
	- learning? 
	- victories? 
	- post morten? 
	- objectives? 
	- return on investment?
	- celebrate
	- move project folder to archive and add status note - write about current status, why postponed, where to pick up, lessons learned
- not rigid structure but scaffolding based on second brain
#### Weekly/monthly reviews
- getting things done book
- **weekly**: new todos, reflect on achievements, priorities, review notes and sort
- **monthly**: check priorities against monthly/annual goals, achievements, growth opportunitiesÂ 
#### Noticing habits
- write it down immediately
- make notes more discoverable, hone systems regularly
- organize as you go to create the perfect system

- **life tends to teach you exactly what you need to know**
- purpose of knowledge is to be shared
- **things that resonate are already within you - just cant describe**
