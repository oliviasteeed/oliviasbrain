## Summary
### Context
- book by psychologist Elaine N. Aron on highly sensitive people which is an actual biological trait present in a little less than a quarter of the population.
### Main Takeaways
- being highly sensitive is a biological predisposition not a character flaw - accept and forgive yourself for needing less stimulus to become aroused even when that means being different
- treat yourself with tenderness like you would your infant self
### Questions/Connections/Thoughts
- 
## Notes
- everyone has optimal level of arousal to be happy and not bored - highly sensitive people need less arousal. This means they can be less social, and need less stimulation to be overwhelmed.

- highly sensitive people were evolutionarily adaptive - needed warriors for action and hsps for strategy/overseeing warriors

- the plight of the HSP to not play until any and all work is done
> "We cannot play until the details of our work is done. The details are little needles of arousal poking us." (p55)

- inside of you is an infant who was overwhelmed by the world. Take care of them as a means of connecting to yourself 
> "Please don't ignore me. Love me! And like me as I am." (p63) (the plea of the infant/body)
- reminds me of [[Making actions seem altruistic increases motivation to do them]] but with the self

> "Appreciate yourself for being not doing." (p83)

> "Everything happens as it is supposed to, have fun at all costs, walk with beauty above, below and behind." (p212)

- [[Growing up is settling]]
> "Another part of growing up is no longer pretending we will be able to do absolutely everything." 
- we get a piece of the good and we also have an obligation to give a piece back
