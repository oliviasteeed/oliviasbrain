## Summary
### Context
- bridging of Western and Eastern thought to overcome sense of individual alienation
- modern Vedanta
### Main Takeaways
- 
### Questions/Connections/Thoughts
- 
## Notes
- sensation of oneself as a separate ego enclosed in a bag of skin is a hallucination - alienation leads to misuse of technology or harm to each other
## Chapter One
- we are just tubes
- real enlightenment to recognize this is wack to real things - "basic and intense wondering about the sense of things"
- intellectual neurosis
- "wonder is not a disease" - it is what differentiates us from other animals
- technological success at the cost of human wellbeing
 > "each individual is an expression of the whole realm of nature, a unique action of the total universe" - we are not separate
- *where does myth of separation come from? desire for control?*
- creates hostility towards "outside world", lack of shared understanding, 
> "the world beyond the skin is actually an extension of our own bodies"
- religion not enough to unite people - becomes an institution that closes mind to any other viewpoints - the opposite of faith
- faith is ultimate openness, trust in unknown
> "just as money is not real, consumable wealth, books are not life"
- we do not need new religion, we need a new way of selfhood
- comparison is understanding
- we are god playing hide and seek, eventually remember this (death?)
- we have skin to separate inside from outside, god has no shape because there is nothing outside
- turn chaos into order, shuffle the cards and play again just like the word
- science makes you "victim of self-extinction"
- Vedanta - god is underneath everything and plays the world from the inside, ==nothing exists except god==
> "genuine love comes from knowledge" - not guilt or obligation, otherwise just egotistical unselfishness

- thoughts on religion to cope?
- meaning?
- individual? 
- do you find it hard to actually believe this?

## Chapter Two - the game of black and white
- all senses are different forms of touch
> "the eyes touch, or feel, light waves and so enable us to touch things out of reach of our hands"

- neurons can be on or off only, like binary

> "the physical world is basically vibration"

- constant light or sound is actually very fast on/off of the wave crest and trough - eyes and ears register both up and down, conscious mind registers only the up but registers nothing without the down
- melody is hearing spaces between notes on scale - expectations and surprise

> "the whole universe (that is, existence) is a vibration of solid/space"

> "space is the relationship between bodies"

> "imagination cannot grasp simple nothingness and must therefore fill the void with fantasies"

- if there was no space around something there would be nothing else, it would be god, space makes it an entity within the world as opposed to the world itself
- one entity can have no movement, two can but unsure which is moving, three the majority still decides which is moving - can move in a plane, four makes three dimensions in which any of the balls can become the reference point
- first law of relativity - "any galaxy, any star, any planet, or any observer can be taken as the central point of reference, so that everything is central in relation to everything else"

> "all answers are equally right and wrong"

- conscious attention is a narrow slit in the fence, see parts not whole, ignore everything but spotlight of attention so we assume the world is made of pieces instead of one whole

> "you saw, but did not really look"

noticing double process

1. what is interesting/important for survivalÂ 
2. what needs notation - hard to notice if there is no way to describe it

- unlabeled dimensions and vibrations are tuned out

two dimensions of ignorance that fuel ego illusion

1. not realizing opposites are actually poles of the same thingÂ 
2. obsession with conscious attention as the only way to exist - we are "fully hypnotized by its disjointed version of the universe", see the world as parts and play game of black verses white not black and white

- black and white just are - one cannot win
- life/death is biggest duality humans struggle with - animals do not live in constant anxiety about death because they live in the present

> "more usual, today, is the fear that death will take us into everlasting nothingness - as if that could be some sort of experience." - imagination cannot grasp nothingness so fills it with fantasies

- thinking birth is a sickness makes you weak/sensitive to it, thinking it is natural and normal makes it less of a big deal
- death is not a sickness, it is necessary and natural end
- to accept death is to let go of yourself completely - see you are part of the universal Self
- G.I. Gurdjeff - the sole way to save the beings on this planet is make us all aware that we and everyone we see will die - only this will destroy egoism crystallized in them

> "the point is only to know, beyond any shadow of a doubt, that "i" and all other "things" will vanish, until this knowledge compels you to release them"

> "you don't die because you were never born. you had just forgotten who you are"

- death is finally releasing ego prison and realizing you are just part of the connected Self
- being a "real person" - a genuine fake
- applied science - game of order vs chance - "trying to gain maximum control over our surroundings and ourselves" - it's only a game if one side doesn't always win
- paperwork becomes more important than what it records - bureaucracy
- increasing obsession with safety and no mistakes/control - controlled lives with no freedom to explore beyond small box of safety (state parks)

> "aimless strolling is suspicious and irrational" - this is all we used to do. restrained from roots, always need purpose 

- travel is as fast as possible from point to point, makes all points the same point
- the only point to leave the house is discovering surprise and marvels, requires unstructured time

![[IMG_4426.jpeg]]
- yes

- the more you know the future the less reason there is to be alive

![[IMG_4427.jpeg]]
- what is being alive?
- next step of evolution is sacrificing our aliveness

- it's not that there was time/existence before the big bang but that time and space curve in on itself

> "plus Ã§a change, plus c'est la mÃªme chose" - change is an illusion "we are always at the point where any future can take us!"

> "a human body is like a whirlpool" - people and institutions are constants that never stay the same (shared myth)

![[IMG_4428.jpeg]]
- nothing ever really changes
- everything you do changes the future in so many ways it's impossible to understand as one human

![[IMG_4429.jpeg]]
- myth of the technological fix - more technology, more complexity, unforseen circumstances we do not have the capacity to expect
- hedonic adaptation

> "the entire project of conquering nature" - increasing pace of life with no end, stalling faster

> "hallucination that we are two souls in one body - a rational soul and an animal soul"

![[IMG_4430.jpeg]]
- ecstacy of pure existence
### Chapter Three - how to be a genuine fake
- *i already am skip*

- you as a separate bag of skin is a hoax - you are part of the whole, you cannot escape this
- *does he mean environmental influence?*

- "I" - separate from body - you say "I have a body" not "I am a body" - *but why? because body moves in response to "you"?*
- "I" center of body - culturally dependent if that is chest or somewhere on head

> conception of controlling officer in head - "this controlling officer "sees" sight, "hears" sounds, "feels" feelings and "has" experiences."
- *why is this so funny to me?*
- we separate ourselves from our experiences even though we don't have experiences, we experience, there is no intermediate step

- memory important for ego sensation
- *is this why I have no self?*

> "your neurons are part of my external world, and mine of yours!"
- *beautiful*

- we usually see skin as boundary between us and world
- skin is a bridge as much as a barrier

- human race hypnotized into hoax of egocentricity

> "apart from such human artifacts as buildings and roads, our universe, including ourselves, is thoroughly wiggly."

> "are there "things" that wiggle, or are the wigglings the same as the things?"
- we can't handle chaos so caught the world in a net - put everything into categories and boxes - the net is now one of the principles of human thought but it is learned

> "the real wiggly world slips like water through our imaginary nets"
- order is always an illusion and a shared myth

> "the world is no more made of matter than trees are "made" of wood"
- it's not constructed like that

- concept of god outside the world reassures us of intelligent design, nets, laws, logic
- in reality it is disconcerting to believe you are constantly being watched - questioning reigion
- agnostic/atheist/naturalist - the world is automatic and made itself, nothing is on purpose, everything is random chaos, have to fight constantly to keep order
- Nominalism - view of Western science - there is no such thing as human body just smallest units (atoms) it is composed of
- not enough to just ask what it is or what it does because this ignored surrounding context

> "blood in a test tube is not the same thing as blood in the veins because it is not behaving in the same way"

- environment is so influential it is hard to draw boundary between agent and environment

> "the soul is not in the body, but the body is in the soul, and the soul is the entire network of relationships and processes which make up your environment, and apart from which you are nothing"
- [[Myth of the Individual]]

- scientific astrology - full context
- innards are different only in name just like self is separate from environment only in name
- most private thoughts and emotions are not ours - programmed socially

> "society is our extended mind and body"
- because we do not exist outside of community, community is able to convince us we are individuals
- as children convinced we are individual agents - like mini First Cause - *we all want to play god* 
- we must be free, immense pressure to believe there is no pressure
- we must do things because we want to

Rules
![[IMG_4460.jpeg]]

> "through enslaving others he himself becomes the most miserable of slaves"
- paranoia of power

> "Nothing fails like success" - force things to happen that are only acceptable when happen without force
- *why are we afraid of trying?*

- pruners (bacteria and human predators) prevent us from destroying ourselves, respect everyone that dies - they made room for the rest of us

- the individual can be seen as discrete entiry with control, mindless drone with no control or single microcosm of the universe
- differentiation is not separation
- *do we have to have a sense of self?*

> "we are thus breeding a type of human being incapable of living in the presentâ€“that is, of really living"
- if you cannot live in the present there is no point making plans for future - you will never get there, you never arrive - opposite or [[How to Sit]] presence
- education prepares you for future instead or being alive now
- *am i ever alive anymore?*

> "enjoyment is an art and a skill for which we have little talent or energy"

> "we have untold stacks of recorded music from every age and culture, and the most superb means of playing it. But who actually listens? Maybe a few pot smokers."
- creation consumption balance

- America is not materialism because we aren't enjoying the materials - they are not pleasurable but symbols of pleasure
- because they aren't made with care, just made to sell and make money
> "success in this world is vanity"
- well made goods cannot keep up with demand so have to be made poorly

![[IMG_4462.jpeg]]
- this usually leads to withdrawal, could lead to collaboration and awareness ideally
