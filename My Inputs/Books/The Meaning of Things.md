## Summary
### Context
- book from the 80s covering philosophical examination of object relations and anthropological study of object relations in American families 
### Main Takeaways
- everything human's produce (including our [[Psychic energy]]) is a translation of the sun's energy
	- do not waste the sun!
### Questions/Connections/Thoughts
- 
## Notes
- [[Money is God]] (p32)

- relationship with objects not instincts cause instinctual needs (p46)

- if things attract attention excessively there is no more [[Psychic energy]] for the rest of life, objects no longer liberate but bind us (p53)
	- also with social media, content
	- owning things takes mental energy

- furniture only became the norm in late Middle Ages when affluent/settled middle class developed. Before that people didn't regularly have furniture. Before it was a symbol of highest authority. (p59)

- art for art's sake is a new concept, before a beautiful object had a purpose and was used pragmatically also (p61)

- [[Enjoyment is the subjective feeling of cultivation]] (p86)
- - the self is created through cultivation (p218)

- through objects we form a self (p91)
	- like [[The Dialectics of Shopping]] where relationships are mediated mainly through objects as well

- obsession with tools of production to form a self is outdated and has sexist roots (p96)

- children and adults use different [[Levels of processing]] to perceive objects - children more visceral/behavioural (because don't have capacity for advanced conceptual thought yet), adults more reflective
- objects children like are about present use, objects adults like are about past usage (p100)
	- is beginning to think abstractly natural or taught? would we think like children forever without education/exposure to other ways of thinking? probably
	- the brain can adapt/become something else
	- [[Flying too close to the sun of the brain's potential]]

- initially form self through actions on objects/control of kinetics in childhood
- then through impulse/emotional control in adolescence (autonomy)
- then through helping others and relationships in adulthood (p117-119)

- men's special objects are about achievement 
- women's special objects are reminders of family (p143)

- [[Love is attention invested for someone else's sake]] (p143)

- automating and abstracting follows [[Technological determinism]] - assuming more technology is better when it is actually abstracting us further from our work and meaning
- There Will Come Soft Rains Ray Bradburry short story - automated household continues to operate after humans are wiped out from nuclear war. What are we freeing up cognitive space for? (p144)

- meaning, not material possessions is the goal (p145)

> "As long as things mean only what they are supposed to mean a person cannot grow beyond the boundaries set by culture and socialization" (p181)

- [[Growing up is settling]] - reality that you can't have it all. To have a warm household you need to invest your [[Psychic energy]] in it at the expense of other pursuits
- creating a family and a home take psychic energy investment, usually made by women (p214)
	- a family is intangible but one of the most fulfilling things you can have. a transient thing though - [[Atmosphere in places are made of the people. Personality makes it a place you want to be]] and eventually the people grow up or die and what once was is no longer so what was the psychic energy for? I guess to cultivate the offspring to be the best possible new members of society.

- goals hierarchy (p249)
	- proving individual existence/control
	- inclusion in social relationships/rewards
	- cosmic goals of relations between self and community/ecology/craft
