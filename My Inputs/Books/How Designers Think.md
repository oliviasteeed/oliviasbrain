## Notes
- the design process is reciprocal cycle between understanding and solving the problem

- [[Design is a process not a destination]]
> "Design is not an end in itself." (p127)

- individuals come to problems/opportunities with everything they have learned before - inputs come through into outputs
>"[[Intellectual baggage]]" (p162)

> "Design is directed towards solving a real-world problem while art is largely self-motivated and centres on the expression of inner thoughts." (p141)

- design is prescriptive - solving problem, creating new
- science is descriptive - finding problem and understanding what exists
