## Summary
### Context
- Study on shopping habits of middle-class people in a neighbourhood in England by anthropologist Daniel Miller with aim to consider shopping seriously and what it means emotionally and relationally.
### Main Takeaways
- Shopping is a (the?) key method we maintain relationships with others
- through shopping we establish who we want to be and who we want others to be, we are comforted by others fitting into roles and norms reinforced by shopping and material possessions
- modernity is contradictory and complex - we seek things to explain it or make it simpler (like categories of right and wrong that we can impose on purchases)
- 
### Questions/Connections/Thoughts
- do you need to conform to shopping norms to feel normal/like you're doing it 'right'?
- can you have a fulfilling relationship without any material gifts? is deviation from social norms surmountable or is there always a level of normalcy we require?
## Notes
 - Miller describes shopping as a tension between expressing individuality at a local level and accepting global generalization, stating “shopping comes to be understood as a constant attempt to at least gain a respite from these tensions, which are never, ultimately, resolvable. In the area of political economy, however, where actual shoppers are divested of power, this tension is shown to be increasingly oppressive and dangerous.” (p3).

- “Understanding is heightened, not lessened, by our appreciation that is constantly being made redundant by the dynamics of our world.” (p4). 

- Miller describes how people use consumption as a means to “overcome their process of alienation from the forces that create commodities,” and as a “mode for the free expression of the creative subject.” (p4). 

- While summarizes the key point of Hegel’s book, Philosophy of Right as “that the fundamental problem of modernity was the increasing distance between particularity and universality and the forms of oppressive abstraction that sundered institutions from their original aim of serving human welfare.” (p5).

- Miller explains choosing a street or his study by the fact that in Britain, at least in popular consciousness, life happens on the street. He compares US sitcoms, that usually have a home or work setting, to British soap operas (and even academic work), centering around locations and streets. Miller states, “there is now considerable evidence for the significance of the street as a genuine core to identification with locality in British working-class culture.” (p7). Is this because North America is mainly car-centric, whereas Europe has better public transit so people are more likely to actually experience streets as opposed to driving past them? Does this change social habits?

- Miller defined discourse as “the manner in which language and practice become routinized and externalized beyond the expressions of particular individuals and become, therefore, a common location for the standard generation of normative ideals and sentiments.” (p15). Discourse as construction of normal. He goes on to define normative as “a pressure, most often a moral or consensual pressure, to behave according to the precepts being described.” (p16). 

- In a discussion of couples buying anniversary gifts, Miller notes that gifts were idealized as essential and positive aspects of relationship development, but in reality were often done last minute and without much thought, as “last-minute embodiments of the emptiness of the purchases as a ritual of obligation.” (p19). I feel like gift giving as a tradition needs to be examined more. It’s just the assumption that at a birthday or occasion there will be gift giving, but it is no longer tied to anything meaningful beyond normative obligations. Gift-giving is a burden instead of an opportunity to demonstrate care. Often, to the giver, the actual gift is irrelevant, it’s just a box-check for an obligation. I guess it makes sense in a capitalist society for the exchange of goods to become the primary demonstration of care and love.

- Miller discusses how parents use purchasing food for their children as a form of love, but that the actual purchases are irrelevant compared to “how the purchase reflects (their) desires for and expectations of a relationship” (p20). He gives the example of a mother trying to engage her three year-old son in grocery shopping by asking him what he wants, and when he doesn’t express particular interest in anything, buying fish filets he gestured at to satisfy her expectations of engagement. This is interesting that we use commodities to express what we wish relationships were.

- Miller describes taste as “less a representation of difference than a process in the creation of relationships” (p21) constructed by social dynamics.

- Miller explains that people often use shopping to feel closer to idealized norms, “a great deal of shopping consists of one person envisaging a situation in which the act of shopping would resolve a tension between some normative model and what the actual person one is shopping for appears to want.” (p22). In relationships and individually, shopping and gifts are used as “a little push in the particular direction desired, such that there is a good chance that it will be accepted and will be instrumental in changing the order.” (p33). 

- Miller explains how shopping choices are construed as love or lack of love by intimate partners, depending on the gift specificity. He explains, “people are touched by a partner who is knowledgeable and sensitive enough to select precisely the right garment for them; equally, a thoughtless choice is evidence that love has not been translated into the detailed effort demanded of it” (p23). However, disappointment at generic gifts can be reconciled through conflicting norms. Miller notes for example that “men in general are viewed as rarely living up to romantic expectations, so in failing to achieve one norm, (male partners) appear typical of (their female partners’) notions of what men are like.” (p22). 

- Miller explains that norms deeply influence our behaviour, and notes “the importance of viewing relationships as a triad in which the normative is as much a key agent as the two partners themselves.” (p26). He gives the example of a wife being upset by her husband’s hasty shopping choices, while preferring to browse for longer, however insists that this behaviour is in accordance with the wife’s expectations for men, and deviation from this would be more upsetting than the tension embodying stereotypical roles creates.

- “Whenever mothers experience rage against their infants they may attribute this or indeed any problem for the infant to their own failings as a mother. The infant appears natural and perfect and never cries without good reason; crying is almost always attributed to some failing of the mother. Mothers therefore idealize the concept of motherhood, which they constantly see themselves as failing to live up to.” (p34).

- “Particularity is developed largely through a constant reference to normativity.” (p35). 

- Miller explains that consumerism is constructed by demand, “the dominant concern of shoppers is anxiety not only over reconciling discourses with individual persons but also in developing some self-confidence in determining for themselves what such persons are supposed to be like in the first place. The constant hope is that there is a convincing discourse somewhere that will tell them.” (p35). This is the promise of advertising, that there is something out there to fix us.

- Miller explains that as children develop, their autonomous desires are born from influences outside of the home and family, starting with food, with preferences often influenced by television. Then they focus on clothes and appearance through adolescence, influenced by peers. Miller argues "the constant attack on the evil impacts of commerce is in part an attempt to reconfigure the role of mothers as preserving the natural link that the infant is seen as inheriting from her from the corruption of these external influences."  (p38). *As a parent, you have to accept the loss of control as your child will live in a world much greater than your house, but reconciling this with the knowledge of the full range of experiences and false/harmful information media and social influence can offer must be terrifying.*

- Miller argues that "the individual is best understood today as an example of kinship, indeed, quite likely the most important kin relationship in our contemporary society." (p41). Despite the strong individualism present in Western societies, Miller claims they are especially ripe with self-kinship, as the relationship with the self is highly valued.

- Miller discusses the view of [[The true self is what we decorate for presentation]] through tribes in highland Papua New Guinea: "for the New Guinea highlander it is not the "natural" physiognomy that one merely happens to be born with that reveals the self, but the self that is constructed through the labour of self-decoration. For them it is obvious that the true self is what one constructs not merely fortuitously starts." (p44). He compares this to Western show shopping, wherein a shopper decides what kind of person they are, and what self they want to reinforce, through their show choices. *This is really interesting because it goes against feminist statements that the true self is the body you were born in. Even people living a more 'natural' life have high value on self-decoration so I guess the consumerist mess we are in now was inevitable? Because who am I? My body that I was born with by chance or the things I spend my money and time on? This also goes into classism where certain 'selves' are only accessible through money.*

- using shopping as means to cultivate desired self, even when tension between that and reality, as in case of woman married to man with creative career feeling pressure to be more cultured than she is
> "she is intimidated by her own projections of who she needs to be." (p46)

- viewing objects as sensual, like in this example of a man passionate about books
> "Oh yeah it turns you on, because don't forget, books are very sexual. You smell the cover; it's like a young female, isn't it?.. I mean it's also got an argument that you haven't yet fathomed out, so you haven't mastered somebody else's thought. I mean invariably you're disappointed because a lot of them are marketed rather than having any sort of substance in, but yes, it's tactile, it smells good, it's new, and you might just change your level of thought by looking into it." (p47)

> "objects are an integral part of the process by which relationships are formed and maintained." (p51)

- what we want out of relationships is for people to need us - including wanting material goods we can provide for them
> "what makes a relationship meaningful, as opposed to merely having meaning, is almost always a process of objectification. We hope to make out close relations desire that which we can provide for them and thereby appreciative of our labour of love in shopping." (p53)
- reminds me of [[Anxious Attachment]] where you need to be needed but I guess this is true to some degree in any relationship - you are aiming to merge with another

- tension between individuality of relations/connections (being truly known) and fitting into norm boxes with gift giving
> "within this expression of our care and concern... is a dialectical tension between specificity in the form of the actual person one is shopping for and universality in the form of discourse about the category of kin to which they belong." (p53)

- using media to form our concept of [[Normalcy]]
> "We are constantly talking about actual friends and relatives, but also interpreting television soap operas or newspaper stories about celebrities in terms of normative models of kinship. How partners, parents, or siblings ought to be." (p54)
> "One of the most common responses to questions about community was the precise phrase, "It's not like Coronation Street here, you know.""

- misunderstanding shopping to think we use it to express individuality - we more often use it to avoid alienation by purchasing normal goods
> "Overwhelming evidence that shoppers ignore most of the diversity of goods that already exist and emphasize the standard purchases such as yet more pasta dishes, little black dresses, or seaside holidays. Although consumption as specificity may be used to negate the [[Alienating experience of the market and other massive institutional forms]], this need not be through an idiom of individual free choice. What makes people feel secure from such forces of alienation is not the development of the self but the development of relationships." (p55)

> "the senses may be the last place, rather than the first place, from which we encounter the world around us." (p66)

- sociality in two distinct modes:
	- working class - wary of neighbours and inviting people over but friendly in public
	- middle class - eager to invite others over to their homes
- probably embarrassed of renting/smaller homes?

- hairdressers acting as mediators for the family - members will talk to them but not each other
> "it's amazing what they want to tell each other, but they don't have time. Or they're too self-conscious or inhibited to tell each other, which is quite interesting." (p70)

- [[Atmosphere in places are made of the people. Personality makes it a place you want to be]]
> "The atmosphere was full of fun and gossip. Today, however, the launderette is a rather sad and empty place where I do not recall ever seeing people engaged in conversation with others they had not come with, except on strict functional matters such as how to use the machines." (p75)
> "within the twenty or so shops there were always a couple where the personalities of the owners or assistants turned them into key sites for neighbourhood sociality." (p76)

- smaller grocery stores suck because they go through stock slower so it is less fresh (p77)
- residents have less affection for local/independent stores in correlation with more of them being owned/run by immigrants (p84)

- people (especially elderly and middle class) speak fondly of independent shops but in actuality prefer and frequent large chain stores (p91)
> "Elderly people do not in practice look to the nostalgic local shops. After all, they were young during the peak period of modernism and the belief in progress. In private, they look positively to what they see as the bright lights and clean modernity of the largest shops." (p98)
- [[Why do we pretend to hate new things and romanticize old things?]]

> "media image of friendly neighbours popping into each other's houses was a myth." (p95)
- I wonder if the past is remembered more friendly/fondly because the people that remember it were kids then, and the world is more friendly then?

- shopping and consumption as a joint activity to build relationships
> "[[Much consumption is actually collectivism masquerading as individualism]]" (p95)

- the 'working class' is a construct created by the middle class
> "The British media that created the popular image of working class life itself began as an almost entirely middle class fiefdom." (p96)


- warm neighbourhoods are created by women and children (p97)

- people's preconceptions influence how they perceive reality - they cannot reconcile when preconceptions don't match reality. Example of local shop that sells items for very cheap, despite the owner being nice everyone assumes he is shady because of unrealistically cheap prices.
> "It is ideology rather than experience that seems to determine how people learn from the particular shops they encounter." (p105)

- phenomenology - Western humans use myth and kinship instead of being phenomenological themselves like their ancestors/Aboriginal societies. Phenomenology is to balance contradictions.
> "The concern with the experience of the phenomenal world is a sign of the nature of that more important transcendent world that can never be experienced." (p109)

- expectations of community become impossible to live up to/reconcile with reality
> "discourses of community that create a burden in that they do not arise from the experience of practice of sociality, but rather, they relate first to ideals of sociality that transcend any such experience. This, then, poses the problem of finding a suitable vehicle for the objectification of such ideals so that at least some semblance to community can be envisaged." (p110)

- using exotic (expensive) foods to feel superior to others
> "[[Cosmopolitan taste is used as the basis for class discrimination]]" (p118)

- using 'health' as a code word for beauty
> "the reasons for avoiding a high-fat diet related to a public discourse on health, which all the informants could recite backward, but there are many times in conversation when it becomes clear that the main issue of concern is their physical appearance. One can listen for some time to a conversation that appears to demonstrate a concern with the environment and that is evidence for the altruism of the speaker, before it becomes quite clear that almost all the incentive for spending the extra money or searching out the pure ingredient is coming from a fear of the harm the food will do to the speaker and their family if some polluting substance is ingested." (p122)

- blending different moral acts together as monoliths of 'good' and 'bad'
> "they perceive a moral dimension so that they know generally what is "good" and what is "bad," and it really doesn't matter in practice how the various implications of the various moralities involved coalesce or contradict each other. So following a religious rule may become seamlessly integrated into a worry about pesticides and making sure your child has the work discipline considered appropriate to the better class of primary school." (p123)

- using opposition to certain companies or buying practices to assert morality and identity. Doesn't always translate to action.
> "in defining themselves as "positions" people are often much clearer about what they are against than what they are for." (p124)
> "there were a number of these shopping expiditions that included discussions about buying Green or organic goods. But even where these discourses continue right inside the shop, they hardly ever generated actual ethical purchases." (p125)
- [[Cognitive Dissonance]]of acting different than beliefs (or what you think beliefs should be) - how is this reconciled?

- only caring about green/ethical purchasing if it has health benefits/promises to purchaser
> "Green shopping is not in practice ethical shopping; it derives from a strong sense of self-interest based on the idea that non-Green foods will be harmful to the purchaser. If we remove this factor, then it is hardly an exaggeration to say that ethical concerns are nonexistent as a factor determining shopping choice." (p126)
- funny because shopping green does benefit us in longterm (health of planet etc) but I guess this is too far away/indirect/we know we can't make that much of a difference to make it a motivator
- motivated by 'health' which is a code word for beauty which is a code word for fitting into standards

- [[Consumer responsibility as new religious morality]]
> "with the decline of formal religion, the question of consumer responsibility has almost become the standard substitute for ethics in general in educational and media discussion within the public domain." (p126)

- using 'ethics' as justification and motivation towards health behaviours
> "stance that seemingly expresses an altruistic concern for others but in fact masks an anxiety about one's own health." (p130)
> "It comes as something of a surprise to have engaged in half an hour of general discussion about Green and ethical issues only to analyze the taped conversation and realize that in the end the sense of doing good came down to avoiding high fat foods." (p131)
- using morality around food as a motivation because otherwise not enough discipline? or is this learned from internalized fatphobia?

- people like to thrift or make ethical purchases to feel like they have done enough for the world and are contributing as much as necessary. trying to make shopping an expression of altruism (doing it for others/for the world) to make them feel better about it.
> "give the shopper the feeling they have done their bit, but in practice at no cost to themselves." (p131)

- [[Green ideology is just latest iteration of fear of consumption]]. Using shopping itself to negate fear of consumption by turning it into devotion to thrift,  observation of evils (while engaging in them) and gifts for others
> "While production creates objects such as foods, consumption by its very nature destroys them. As a result, there are many cosmologies and regions of the world where consumption is seen as intrinsically evil and destructive. I have argued that much of the logic of traditional sacrifice and exchange is itself an attempt to avoid these dangerous and immoral consequences of consumption as an act that uses up resources... Where in other societies aspects of sacrifice and exchange are employed to prevent the realization of these imminent evils of consumption, in our society the practice of consumption itself is turned into a three-stage ritual that has the same effect on negating what is seen as its destructive nature." (p132) 

- [[Shopping is modern love]]
> "the primary motivation of most contemporary shopping is the desire to express love implicitly through a material practice." (p136)

- in the last 30 years material love has become more personal
> Where love was once a more conventional and normative quality that could be expressed by established gestures such as bringing home flowers on an appropriate occasion, today it has become judged as an expression of highly individualized sensitivity ti the particular person. What are increasingly required are gestures that demonstrate careful research and knowledge of the object of one's love. (p136)

- [[People don't have enough money to live up to perceived norms]]
> "Most ordinary shoppers in see themselves as struggling against incomes lower than they feel they need on the basis of a normative model structured by reference to other consumers." (p138)

- [[Discourse]] creates moral pressure to conform (p140)

> "What we observe is the constant process by which they become individuals only as social and ethical beings." (p141)

- shift in power in recent history from manufacturer to retailers harnessing power as a brand. brands demand cheaper prices so costs are cut farther up the line, retailers determine what is produced (based on what sells already) creating [[Slop economy]] (p163)
> "If Tesco and Sainsbury's won't sell it, you might as well not make it." (p163)

- virtualism - fetishizing the consumer yet replacing consumers with model of ideal consumers
> "term virtualism is justified in that quite often the push toward greater abstraction and pure finance turns out to be detrimental to actually working capitalism." (p174)
- and it's not even good for business!

- shopping as societal maintenance/proliferation of ethics
> "Hegelian concept Sittlichkeit - ethical society in which people are reconciled to institutions of modernity." (p177)
> "social relations are continually being constructed and reconstructed through the relationship between objects." (p178)

- we make institutions as proof of human reason and then use this as bases to critique institutions. 
> "Hegel argues humanity creates institutions and customs that express a general intention in the world which objectifies human reason. This, then, provides us with a criteria by which to analyze and judge institutions." (p179)
- institutions get out of hand and start to control us
> "it is an intrinsic property of all cultural forms and institutions developed by societies that they may develop an autonomous self-interest and aggrandizement such that they no longer can be said to be an expression of reason. Instead they become forms that obfuscate rather than help clarify our goals." (p180)

- education a primary force of normalization and socialization
> "education in countries such as Britain and France sometimes become more important in reproducing class distinctions than inculcating understanding." (p180)"
- does learning that discrimination is there make it worse because then you know to have that bias?

- [[Connections with others are actually connection to who we think they are]]
> "we relate primarily to our internalized projections of others" (p183)

> "constant grounding of social relations in material relations" (p184)

- families organized around consumption (p185)

- families give safe institution to develop as individual 
> "family is the precondition for development, rather than the suppression of the emotional and personal development of individuals, whose very individuality is always itself a social and ideological project." (p185)
> "family is only institutional sphere within which one finds emotional acceptance of one's particularity." (p185)

> " retailing as male seduction of female desire" (p189)

- stores for more than pragmatic purpose - create sense of community and place to share community knowledge
> "They would thereby contribute directly to local expression of civil society that would provide several roles in formation and maintenance of community, for example, as a place where localized information is shared around a range of interests from babysitting to sports. The practical functions of the shop would go beyond the privatized world of the household and create some sense of community that has a resonance of neighbourhood and locality." (p190)

- civil society is means to achieve higher consciousness - mediated in part by shopping
> "Shopping here becomes a point at which people come to consciousness of the nature of larger political and universalistic aspirations and responsibilities." (p194)

- what we need is to be part of a lager system - shopping and consumerism is just a manifestation of that basic desire
>"[[The ideal of pure individual fulfillment is not only futile but based on a fantasy]]" (p195)
> "Individuals can attain their ends only in as far as they themselves determine their knowing, willing and acting in a universal way to make themselves links in this chain of social connections." (p195)
> "we can see shoppers almost comically floundering around in their desire to espouse and to practice discourses that would bring them into a higher ethical relationship to the world around them and yet which prove elusive, contradictory and sometimes not only superficial but just plain empty... this is the place where we mourn the loss of something unattainable - that is, full mutual recognition. While on other occasions these same ethical aspirations can become a key moment in which we really do feel we have transcended the stupidity of what we think of as self-interest." (p195)

- as citizens of civil society we have "responsibility towards raising of critical consciousness" (p197)

- the market as new expression of democracy
> "decisions that previously were made by governments are being dumped onto individual shoppers with the claim that the market provides a more democratic system of choice than does democracy." (p198)
- [[Diffusion of responsibility]] means nothing really changes

> "the problem of how we can feel at home in a situation where a largely anonymous bureaucracy comes to represent us in the form of our universalistic aspirations." (p198)

- 'freedom' in the United States is actually proof of control
> "the United States appears to be dominated by what Hegel would probably have found the most pernicious and mistaken ideologies of freedom, represented as the choice of the desocialized individual acting against what is viewed as "the system"." (p199)
- true freedom is not needing to fight at all
> "It is as though we have lost the understanding we once had of the role of bureaucracy in securing welfare and equality" (p199)

- norms are a false reality because we don't see real people in action not performing very often
> "We face a world that looks simultaneously like an imploding and exploding universe. On the one hand, society seems ever more private. Households disappear from the public domain. They may be exposed to vast global knowledge, but their point of access is increasingly through television and the Internet, consumed behind closed doors. When they present themselves to most academics in other disciplines it is through the normative discourse of legitimization, elicited in response to questionnaires and focus groups. These researchers must simply assume a congruence between their data and the life behind those doors." (p202)
> 
> "getting real (or getting a life!) means remembering why the research is being carried out" (p203)

> "The text attempts to make sense of the larger context that is otherwise likely to remain fragmented within the everyday experience." (p204)
- reminds me of UX design

- dialectic is trying to reconcile expectations and realities
> "I take the dialectic to be the passion of humanity struggling to bring that intrinsically contradictory process we call culture back into the service of our self-creation, and this can be observed equally in the struggle of a shopper reconciling discourse and particularity in the act of shopping or in the struggle of the discipline of anthropology seeking a new role in reconciling through understanding the vast and fragmented nature of modernity." (p205)
