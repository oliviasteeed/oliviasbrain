## Summary
### Context
- book on neuroscience and psychology by Barbara Tversky - argument that movement and embodied experience is foundation of higher level/abstract thought
- a lot longer than it has to be
### Main Takeaways
- movement aids thinking - abstract thought is based on movement 
### Questions/Connections/Thoughts
- 
## Notes
- no brain area codes the date, when/why are imperfect and biased in memory (p34)

- categories help us quickly understand what it is/what we can do with it (p52)

- neurons are arranged in grids corresponding to location boundaries to help us localize and understand spatiality, created in infants too (p67)
- allocentric - place to place

- mirror neurons fire when performing and observing the action, gesture communication precedes language (p111)

- the "tree shape" with branching is everywhere - rivers, blood vessels, neurons (p160)
	- clearly this is a low effort high reward structure

- envisioning the near future makes us 'outside ourself' and reduces [[Fundemental Attribution Error]] (p181)

[[Laws of Cognition]]
- there are no benefits without costs
- action moulds perception
- feeling comes first
- the mind can override perception
- cognition mirrors perception
- spatial thinking is the foundation of abstract thought
- the mind fills in missing information
- when thought overflows the mind, the mind puts it into the world
- we organize the world the way we organize our mind
