## Summary
### Context
- 7 day guide to improving your relationship from psychologists John Gottman and Julie Schwartz Gottman who have studied what makes relationships last for over 20 years.
### Main Takeaways
-  maintain relationship by doing small things often, not one big thing
- [[Love is not enough to make a relationship last]], relationships are a constant active practice of getting to know each other as you both change and grow
- seeing positive instead of criticizing, mutual admiration and respect are key predictors of relationship success
### Questions/Connections/Thoughts
- is commitment really all it takes?
## Notes
#### Day 1: answer bids for connection
- turning towards bids for connection is biggest predictor of relationship success
- adding to the emotional bank account with turning towards - more leeway with each other
- practice turning towards and you cannot grow a grudge anymore
- on the same team
- 10 minute check in - what do you need from me today?
- take every potential moment of connectionÂ 
- if other lashes out see the unmet bid underneath and address it
#### Day 2: ask deep questions
- ask the big questions when getting to know, then ask small questions once used to each other. need to keep asking big questions because the answers change with time - keep getting to know each other
- stay interested in each other
- anyone can surprise you if you give them the opportunity to do so
- relationship is process of meeting people again and againÂ 
- how we connect is seeing and knowing other - asking open ended questions
- love maps - dreams, fears, desires, plans
- disagreement is about unrealized dreams and fears
- always be learning about the other person - update, grow and deepen love map
#### Day 3: focus on positive
- we naturally notice negative more than positive, issue is not that they don't do nice things, it's that we don't notice it
- negative bias is default
- thriving culture of appreciation between partners - scan for positive - most immediately impactful behaviour - scan for positive
- approach emotions (happiness, love, anger) in one part of brain, depression emotions (sadness, disgust) in another. actively looking for positive rewires brain to feel more approach and have more positive bias
- no criticism allowed
- intentionally pay attention to what they are doing right
- gratitude dissolves combativeness
- 4 horsemen: criticism, contempt, defensiveness, stonewalling
- be around your partner without distractions, write down everything they do that's positive
- culture of appreciation
#### Day 4: admire and respect each other
- couples that stay happily together can easily state positive specific behaviours, characteristics and memories together - actively admiring the other person
- why did you fall in love? should be easy to answer
- contempt - most likely predictor of divorce, makes you literally sick
- 5:1 positive to negative interactions to keep relationship lasting during conflict
- 20:1 positive to negative interactions in normal life to maintain relationship
- intention means nothing, impact means everything
- admiration - who they _are_ not what they do, leaning into good qualities (not rose coloured glasses)
- show you are happy to see someone first when you see them again
- you can focus on flaws or attraction it's your choice - admiration is an active choice
- what do you cherish and how could no one in the world replace them? then tell them
- affection, respect and friendship are foundations of longterm relationships - all active choices
- give your partner a genuine compliment - 3-5 positive words to describe them, notice when demonstrating qualities you love, express it each time they do it
#### Day 5: ask for what you need
- ask for what you need
- behaving as if they are mind readers, don't ask for what we want so they can't meet expectations
- taught that needs are weak and unacceptable
- criticism is saying they have personaity flaw - who they are not what they do
- how you start conversation matters - start with you not about their defecit
- tell them how to shine for you
- before important conversation ask are you available
#### Day 6: touch
- sexual satisfaction is not actualy about the sex - cuddle, pda, say i love you every day, kiss passionately
- become aroused by touch for sake of touch instead of jumping into sex
- touch is profoundly influential on wellbeing and closeness - touch starvation
- touch helps you connect emotionally and trust each other more
- physical touch is painkiller
- 6 second kiss, 30 second hug
- oxytocin is drug
- as many mini touch opportunities as possible
#### Day 7: go on a date
- go on a date
- endless to do list turns you off to all openness, devitalized
- purpose is expanding love maps and physical proximity
- commit to it no matter what
- simple, not about place/plan, about conversation/newness
#### Conclusion
- keep re-meeting each other, you and them are always changing, stay curious
- making it last just means deciding to make it last
- share what you need and give what they need
- have meeting once a week/month about what felt good and 3 things you appreciate
- write at end of day the ways you changed and why
